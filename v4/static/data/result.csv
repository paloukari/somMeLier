peach, passion fruit, apricot, yellow apple and lyche on the rich nose. Impressive.. Light body, med acid bring a great rich palate with nose flavors and banana and lime. Finish is med strength but long with citrus notes of the fruits and a floral add-on. Impressive white.. Yet delicate still safe with fish...

Long time ago I drank a pinot noir from chilli and I can honestly say that this one just tastes soo satisfying! In the nose you won't instantly notice the perfume of the magical pinot noir grape, just a fruit BOMB and lavender. In the mouth a nice ballanced piece of wood, raspberry and wallnuts. To explain this wine in 1 sentence: a nice winter evening with your girlfriend/boyfriend and a fireplace. Oh and ofcourse red curtains =). Cheers!!!!

Very special Malbec, crafted with a rare kind of vines which sprouts are darker than the normal ones, giving origin to the name Brote Negro (Black Sprout). The winery Vina Alicia is focused on quality, producing a limited quantity of bottles per label, according the availability of good grapes in each vintage. The result is “excellence “.

This Priorat 2005 is really a character. The nose features mostly black fruits and vanilla. In the mouth, vivid acidity (cranberry like), fresh and firm tannins make me wonder if this is really a 2005. It's body is surprisingly thin when compared with the characters. It could still stay in your cellar for many years but enjoy now is also pleasant especially with tapas.

This Spanish wine from the Priorat region is a blend of 5 grapes (45% Cariñena + 35% Garnacha + 10% Cab Sauv + 7% Merlot + 3% Syrah) that stayed for 15 months in new French oak barrels. Dark rubi to grenade red color. Very nice and intense red fruit aromas with notes of spices, oak and coffee. Full-bodied (14.5%), not completely balanced wine due to some overacidity, strong alcohol and robust, almost rounded tannins, leaving a persistent, dry finish. An 88-GB pts mature wine that might need some decanting.

Quinta Essência is produced with Montepulciano grapes harvested in the 2015 harvest in São Joaquim SC, at more than 1300m altitude. Made by Quinta Da Neve winery, it spends 24 Months in French oak barrels. Ruby red with violet tones, it shows floral aromas and fresh red and black fruits with notes of spices, which are repeated on the palate. Medium bodied, velvety tannins and balanced acidity, long and persistent finish, is a great wine.

Tight BlackBerry and dark berry aromas. A hefty whack of new oak dominates the palate. Soft tannins. Underlying herbal / mint note. Nice. Bordeaux more than Italian in style. A bit too much oak to be elegant and get 4 stars for me.

That would be appropriate for my city's entrance for the last few days. It's been so warm it actually feels like hell. So I opened this lovely South African Sauvignon Blanc. Yes, it's monday. No, I am not an alcoholic. I just need some freshness. Great fresh aromas, grapefruit, passion fruit, melon. Beautiful bright light color and great acidity. Hell is OK! :)

Wines from Portugal have usually good quality/price ratio. This is the case. Great aromas of raspberries jam with ripe plums. Low tannins, medium acidity, dry but soft and easy to drink. The 3.7 average in Vivino reflects exactly its quality but considering its price, 4 stars.

Uruguayan wine made of 60% indian Tannat + 40% Merlot grapes aged for 6 months in USA oak barrels. Very dark ruby red color. Intense ripe red/black fruit aromas with strong notes of toasted bread, wood, dried meat, menthol, spices and leather. Medium-bodied (13.0%), not fully balanced wine, quite acidic and nicely alcoholic, kind of bitter, pairing robust, smooth tannins. Finish is fairly intense, dry, still bitter and persistent. 78-GB pts is fair enough for this not fully rounded wine!!

Rosso rubino scarico e trasparente. Al naso sentori di amarene sotto spirito, poi vaniglia e noce moscata, caffè tostato e pepe, frutta a bacche nere. In bocca apre molto bene, con un bel frutto tridimensionale, spezie ben dosate en una bella sensazione di affumicatura che è poi tipica del Pinot Nero. Anche i sentori di caffè tostato sono piacevoli, così come la moderata freschezza finale, i tannini morbidi, la buona sensazione di pepe e la persistenza. Un bel Pinot Nero trentino

100% Fiano. Nose is very elegant with a mix of flowers (acacia) and herbs (savage), with dried fruit and fresh bread. Very rich in mouth with perfect harmony and a sexy minerality that continues in the long final.

M+intensity on nose. Cooked blueberries, black currant, black plum, smoke, herbal notes. Dry, M acidity, M+tannins, M+alcohol, M bodied. Clove, nutmeg. Great concentration of fruits. Seducing palate with ripe fruits and a mysterious smokiness, also herbal notes adding depth and complexity. Tannins are ripe and velvety. Finish is M+in length.

A bit unbalanced. Might be faulty storage as it was sold from a rack in a hot store. Anyway, a wine full of terroir with lava stone minerality, pencil strokes, cassis and basil.

Notas frutadas. Red ruby colour. Aromas of cherry, olive. On the palate it's dry with medium acidity, low body and low tannins. Fruity notes. 85/100

Opened to make up for bad luck with Pampaneo. Started with aromas of barnyard and dried prunes. The same in mouth: lean, unsweet, with notes of wood and prunes. Silky soft, slightly unbalanced with low tannins. In an hour becomes more balanced, brighter, opens up with juicy sour cherry and some faint toasted notes. Not bad.

Meh... Just opened but poured through a filter/funnel. Jammie. No finish. Just jam and alcohol... Ten minutes later it's opening up a lot... Tight tannins and if course the ubiquitous berries-like acid. Aged in french oak, ABV 14.5, uh, says here it has SULFITES! 10 more minutes...plums. Still no finish, but the tannic acid ans fruit acid are getting along fine now. It'll do, eh?

Vinitaly 2019. An intensely aromatic orange wine, is a monovarietal of Torontel macerated on the skins for six months and a half. The fermentation of this wine is in open barrels. The palate is of good volume and persistence, well integrated acidity. It is fruity and pleasant to drink. Cheers!

(4,1*) Confraria Só Vinhos SP 22/09 - This wine was my pick for this Carménère night. The bottle that I drank a few months before was a little better. Blend 89% Carmenére; 7% Cabernet Sauvignon ; 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot aged for 24 months in French oak (50% new). Deep ruby red color, aromas of ripe red fruits, spices, tobacco and chocolate. On palate is fruity and full-body, structured with flavors of caramel, cedar, raspberries and hints of vanilla. Finished with good persistence. WE90.

Uruguayan wine made of 60% indian Tannat + 40% Merlot grapes aged for 6 months in USA oak barrels. Very dark ruby red color. Intense ripe red/black fruit aromas with strong notes of toasted bread, wood, dried meat, menthol, spices and leather. Medium-bodied (13.0%), not fully balanced wine, quite acidic and nicely alcoholic, kind of bitter, pairing robust, smooth tannins. Finish is fairly intense, dry, still bitter and persistent. 78-GB pts is fair enough for this not fully rounded wine!!

Good one! A clear rebuy! The deep ruby color shows warm light. The flavors are a mixture of ripe red berries, black cherries and some red plums completed by cloves, coconut, toast and black pepper of 12 month oak aging. The acidity is medium high and offers freshness and the smooth but high tannins give structure to the medium plus body. Dry in taste with a good mouthfeel and some more spicy, dry leathery notes. The finish is medium long and very pleasant. Cheers! (86 P)

This delightful wine was a gift from my friend Homero Gac during my last trip to Chile. It's another contested rating from Mr. RP and his team how gave an unbelievable 83 points to this cool climate Cabernet Franc that is not so usual. Grapes from Casablanca and aged for 15 months in used French oak with 14,5% abv. Aromas of ripe red fruits and coffee (lot of coffee), soft and jammy on palate with flavors of coffee and tobacco with fresh tannins and a delicious aftertaste. Thanks Homero, I liked a lot!!

Earthy and powerful cabernet sauvignon from Raizes vineyard in Campanha. Terroir series. The wine starts with “dry” aroma’s: dried cedar wood, saw dust, dry dirt, cloves. On the palate much more interesting, with boisenberry, leather, more dust. Must be a dry and dusty terroir!

Hints of band aid. Not kidding. At least some remnants of an adolescent accident. Hospitalish. Otherwise, high acidity, very tasty on the palette. Medium tannins, which gives it a nice texture. But smooth enough to enjoy. Short finish, but fairly complete. For £7 it's a bit of a steal tbh.

Interesting argentinian wine. Descomplicated, easy drinking with great value. Limpid pale lemon color. Nose with citric fruits as pineapple and lime, daisies as secondary with a very discret mineral arome at the end. In mouth great “at the point” acidity, refreshing, some saltiness reminding of a petit Chablis, though made of a blend of Chardonnay and Viogner. Left this magic aftertaste, fruity, salty and floral. Quite good!!! Cheers!

3.7. This Bonarda was produced from grapes grown at 1.700 m in Cafayate and was aged for 8 months in 3rd and 4th use French oak. Interesting nose of cigar box, vainilla, toasted brown sugar, menthol, black licorice and cassis. On the palate it’s the raspberry, followed by the red cherry, that make the greatest impression. The initial attack is quite acidic, but then a bitterness sets in and the finish, while not very long, actually leaves the mouth surprisingly dry.

My experiences with Bonarda are limited, although it’s the second most planted variety in Argentina. Dark violet colour. Chocolate on the nose, fig, blackberry. The palate is more medium bodied in feel but dark fruits. A touch dry and there is late heat. Rated 3.7. At $50 I wasn’t huge on this one.

Earthy and powerful cabernet sauvignon from Raizes vineyard in Campanha. Terroir series. The wine starts with “dry” aroma’s: dried cedar wood, saw dust, dry dirt, cloves. On the palate much more interesting, with boisenberry, leather, more dust. Must be a dry and dusty terroir!

Hints of band aid. Not kidding. At least some remnants of an adolescent accident. Hospitalish. Otherwise, high acidity, very tasty on the palette. Medium tannins, which gives it a nice texture. But smooth enough to enjoy. Short finish, but fairly complete. For £7 it's a bit of a steal tbh.

Very nice, refreshing young Argentinian white wine made of 💯% Chardonnay grape. Clear straw yellow color. Mid-intense and dominant mineral aroma with non-complex citric, white floral and butter notes. Medium body wine (13.1%) disclosing nice acidity and alcohol, crisp, savory and delicious, leaving a fresh, smooth and persistent finish. Paired beautifully with an ”au jus” grilled salmon with lemon risotto dish in this nice, recently opened restaurant. Deserves 84-GB pts!! Recommend both!!

Good flavor as a standalone, clean but definitely heavily on the dry end. Benefits by a long period of aeration. Alcohol, raisins and bleach on the nose. Smoky, fruity chocolate once aerated, with low tannin. Bitterness subsides significantly with time.

Malbec tasting at the Market. We win(e). Today’s winner and at a much better price than Vivino is quoting at the base. Lighter bodied for a Malbec but rewarding in other dynamics, fruit balance, long finish. Insert bottle in cart and head to checkout. :)

Hard to find a Burgundy with nice cost here in Brazil. Even harder a good Burgundy. Nightmare: fair price, burgundy and natural wine. This one gives us all this and more: acidity going to the moon, cherries and a hint of feminine touch given by Clotilde Davenne. She rocked! Equilibrium, body, acidity, low alcohol. Praying for food. 115 reais at De la Croix in São Paulo. Thanks God I bought a full case. See what time can do to this beauty. Love Burgundy, the Holy Land. Pinot noir is a real queen 👑!! Last bt

I was expecting more. Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon qualified as Gran Reserva, aged for 12 months in oak 70% French and 30% American, closed aromas, soiled, lack of balance. Even after some time open didn't get better. Anyway wasn't expensive.

Specific Pinot noir color. intense aromas of raspberry, cherry, strawberry. In a flavor sweet berries, smooth overall, finish is a little bit dry. The wine seems to me rather full bodied for a Pinot. Nice tannins. Surprise. Bob Campbell ( New Zeland wine critic) scores that vintage 94... Decanter 91... I can’t score so highly... What do you think, Vivino members?

Deep Grenat colour with purplish edges. On the nose you can expect raspberry, morning dew, ground forest with oak. On the palate you'll first notice strong dark berries such as raspberry and blueberry. Then comes light young tannins which will delicately cover your mouth. Very enjoyable. Cheers!

Brilliant wine. For me the highlight in the Vinoblesse tasting. Flowery, citrus, vanilla, herbs, richness, volcanic minerality. And all balanced and refreshing. Just fantastic, what a wine.... In a way it is called a copy of white Burgundy, and yes the winemaking in oak and fresh minerality and citrus come a long way, but then again this is more floral and mineral. Great to taste next to each other at this tasting!

Tasted in Jan 2019. 30% of the cork was already wet by the wine. I needed to put the wine in a decanter to remove the acidity and to make the wine more velvety. Interesting to see the cork tester created by the Bodega Patritti by which you can see the condition of the cork along the years. Indeed, it’s really a great wine!

94pts. Pugnitello is an ancient and rare Tuscan grape that naturally produces low yields. For this reason, Tuscan wine producers of the past concentrated on Sangiovese instead, leaving Pugnitello for extinction. Recently rediscovered, the first new bottling of this grape came in 2003 and has been produced every year since except for in 2005. If tasted blind, I would have guessed a feminine style Brunello, perhaps Altesino. Beautiful red fruit, espresso, mocha and leather. Med+ acidity and medium tannins.

I'm not a fan of Casa Silva wines, but this Carmenere has something in its favour: besides the beautiful crimson colour, it tastes really good, well balanced. A true Carmenere.

Wine from a small winery in RS; they do not have mass production nor broad distribution net, only possible to buy at the winery store. About the wine: nice Ruby color, balanced and complex nose of red and dark berries, in the mouth is excellent, smooth, perfectly balanced, velvet tannins, 12,8% alcohol. Half star for the price.

Deep Grenat colour with purplish edges. On the nose you can expect raspberry, morning dew, ground forest with oak. On the palate you'll first notice strong dark berries such as raspberry and blueberry. Then comes light young tannins which will delicately cover your mouth. Very enjoyable. Cheers!

Salento #04 A solid Primitivo, 14.5% abv., matured in French oak for 5-6 months, deep ruby red. Dark forest berries and plums on the nose, followed by earthy scents of damp wood and truffle and enriched by flavours of cloves, vanilla and green tea. Similar on the palate with lots of aromas of ripe berries, vanilla, chocolate and cedar wood. Full bodied with a good balance between med- tannins and a med acidity, med+ length finish. On the other hand, my father really disliked this one.

This is the stuff I could sip all night long. Comes on big strong and surprisingly similar to my mom’s homemade preserves. Surprisingly, because it follows with all sorts of savory notes other than fruit: leather spices tobacco and balsamic. Thanks to 3rd street for a spot on recommendation. The shop said “puglia” so I’m. It sure if this is the right wine - I liked it up rather than using photo.

Very good wine. Still young but with a good presence. Tasted at the ViniBraExpo 2018. Made with 100% Syrah from Vale do São Francisco. Aged for 12 months in new French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, tobacco, herbs and spices. On the palate medium body, good structure and acidity. Soft tannins. Ends with good persistence. I recommend!

Honestly very pleasantly surprised with this wine. It’s a 2014 and still takes open and bright. It’s got very great complexity with crispy on the front and a nice polished finish through. It’s more pear, peach, than crisp bright citric fruits. Really very good will certainly look for more bottles.

(3.8*) O. Fournier Wine Tasting. It will be a great wine but need a few years in cellar to achieve it peak. Should not be open. I tasted vintage 2007 this year and also isn't on its peak. This 100% Malbec is aged for 17 months in oak with 15,0% abv. Ruby-red color with purple reflections, aromas of forest fruits, violets and mineral hints. On palate is not integrated with ""green"" notes, firm tannins and flavors of blueberries and spices. Finished with good persistence.

(87/100) Really rather enjoyable indeed! Lots of soft powerful concentrated black fruit, tied together with a vibrant acidity and some nice subtle touches of sweet oak, soft vanilla and a smoky meaty tone, (charcuterie-sque) that adds a nice savoury element and broadens the palate. Full bodied, medium plus acidity, medium intensity, slightly above average finish. The only thing letting this wine down is it's price tag. I've not made huge explorations into Chilean red, but I know this isn't great vfm.

The evolution of this is quite amazing. On first pop, this was chocolate and coffee on the nose along with cherries and eucalyptus. With some time, the coffee is dialled down to give more subtle herbal notes. The acidity surprised me but not in a bad way. There's a herbal tone to the long finish with perhaps a bit of grip to run alongside that acidity. The structure makes me think this could be nicer in 3-5 years' time

Deep purple colour with little signs of ageing around the rim (2007 vintage is proving a time resistant one!). The nose is reminiscent of garrigue, herbal notes of lavender and eucalyptus. Black cherry, plums, blackberry and dark chocolate and mushrooms. It's rich on the palate, well balanced and with a long finish. Paired with wild ragu gnocchi.

Wow! This well- aged , sumptuous Brunello is more than terrific! A deeply colored ruby, it possesses nuanced aromatics along with notable precision and definition in its smoke, tar, licorice, underbrush and sweet dark fruit. This is solid and racy, with chewy tannins, yet they are caressing and pretty.

A slice of the sunny ☀️ Mediterranean coast in La Clape from low yielding 30-50 years old vines. Deep purple colour, this can age for much longer. Very 'garrigue' style, with flavours of eucalyptus, thyme, wild fennel. Crushed blackberries, dried cherries and lovely dark chocolate and coffee finish. Paired with salt beef bagels;)

The evolution of this is quite amazing. On first pop, this was chocolate and coffee on the nose along with cherries and eucalyptus. With some time, the coffee is dialled down to give more subtle herbal notes. The acidity surprised me but not in a bad way. There's a herbal tone to the long finish with perhaps a bit of grip to run alongside that acidity. The structure makes me think this could be nicer in 3-5 years' time

Deep purple colour with little signs of ageing around the rim (2007 vintage is proving a time resistant one!). The nose is reminiscent of garrigue, herbal notes of lavender and eucalyptus. Black cherry, plums, blackberry and dark chocolate and mushrooms. It's rich on the palate, well balanced and with a long finish. Paired with wild ragu gnocchi.

Wow! This well- aged , sumptuous Brunello is more than terrific! A deeply colored ruby, it possesses nuanced aromatics along with notable precision and definition in its smoke, tar, licorice, underbrush and sweet dark fruit. This is solid and racy, with chewy tannins, yet they are caressing and pretty.

This is the last of the 3 that I tasted at the vineyard itself - well balanced, full bodied - still good tannin levels - lots of fruit character coming through the wine with hints of tar and smoke

Full body, colossal structure, amazing wine. This is more demanding than the simpler ""non-corvo"" Bajancas, and here food pairing is almost obligatory: grilled fatty meats and strong pepper spices.

San Biagio is a tiny producer based in San Bagio Vecchio that has a handsome ha of vineyards. Producing very few bottles it s very difficult to be found elsewhere than Italy. Therefore bottles usually display an expensive price. USD$ 50-80 Neverthless this Brunello di Montalcino worths every dollar spent. Beatifull collor and great tipicity in a still fresh red after more than 10 years. Fantastic!!

Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)

Magnificent wine tasted in Safrada Alentejana. The mysterious name refers to the time when the Syrah grape was not allowed in the Alentejo. Made with 100% Syrah. 8 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, smoked, toasted, spices and oak. On the palate full bodied, structured, complex, good acidity and freshness. Solid tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!

Honestly very pleasantly surprised with this wine. It’s a 2014 and still takes open and bright. It’s got very great complexity with crispy on the front and a nice polished finish through. It’s more pear, peach, than crisp bright citric fruits. Really very good will certainly look for more bottles.

(87/100) Really rather enjoyable indeed! Lots of soft powerful concentrated black fruit, tied together with a vibrant acidity and some nice subtle touches of sweet oak, soft vanilla and a smoky meaty tone, (charcuterie-sque) that adds a nice savoury element and broadens the palate. Full bodied, medium plus acidity, medium intensity, slightly above average finish. The only thing letting this wine down is it's price tag. I've not made huge explorations into Chilean red, but I know this isn't great vfm.

(3.8*) O. Fournier Wine Tasting. It will be a great wine but need a few years in cellar to achieve it peak. Should not be open. I tasted vintage 2007 this year and also isn't on its peak. This 100% Malbec is aged for 17 months in oak with 15,0% abv. Ruby-red color with purple reflections, aromas of forest fruits, violets and mineral hints. On palate is not integrated with ""green"" notes, firm tannins and flavors of blueberries and spices. Finished with good persistence.

A slice of the sunny ☀️ Mediterranean coast in La Clape from low yielding 30-50 years old vines. Deep purple colour, this can age for much longer. Very 'garrigue' style, with flavours of eucalyptus, thyme, wild fennel. Crushed blackberries, dried cherries and lovely dark chocolate and coffee finish. Paired with salt beef bagels;)

This is one of those wines begging for air. Open it at least 1/2 hour before having it. Very dark, beautiful color. High to medium acidity and tannins, improving with time after pouring. Strong body and complex lasting fruit flavors. Recommended only as pairing with meat or strong dishes.

This is the last of the 3 that I tasted at the vineyard itself - well balanced, full bodied - still good tannin levels - lots of fruit character coming through the wine with hints of tar and smoke

Full body, colossal structure, amazing wine. This is more demanding than the simpler ""non-corvo"" Bajancas, and here food pairing is almost obligatory: grilled fatty meats and strong pepper spices.

Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)

Magnificent wine tasted in Safrada Alentejana. The mysterious name refers to the time when the Syrah grape was not allowed in the Alentejo. Made with 100% Syrah. 8 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, smoked, toasted, spices and oak. On the palate full bodied, structured, complex, good acidity and freshness. Solid tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!

A very nice Douro red, made from over 20 local grape varieties. From vines aged up to 120 years. Aged for 18 months in barrels from burgundy. An intense and rich wine, but elegant at the same time. With 8 years of age this wine still has ripe fruit and enough tannins to get you trough the meal. Great concentration, stunning length.

White Portuguese cork, same cork design as on the red version of the same wine. Simple art label with a “P” dominant and other wine info “hided” on the very upper left and right corners. It has a fruity summer alike nose. Refreshing palate, rather complex and staged, starts refreshing, then you feel some stone fruits, and in the end is rather sour, it is a blend of 3 Portuguese grapes (same ppl would argue about Verdelho), stays for quite awhile on the central mouth. It has some character, but complex.

Like Matrix 2, even if you suspect it may not have been as good as last the last one, you're very aware that your worldview has shifted permanently.There is no more ""wool over your eyes to blind you from the truth"". Intense violet,vanilla& white pepper aromas, as well as a Maroela fruit note up front. Mouthfeel-one of the smoothest I've encountered; malolactic conversion making its presence felt in a delightful way. Acidity seems higher than 2010 (pH3.6) RS 3.1g/l TA 5.5g/l Winemaker:Josef Dreyer

100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Good wine. Young but safe to drink; 13,5% ABV very integrated, unnoticeable. Full-bodied. Agglomerate cork. Easy to drink. Acidity is balanced. Aged in French oak for 8 months. Bottled without filtration; contains residues. Deep ruby color. Flavors; hints of strawberry, oak and pepper. Aromas; notes of jam, oak and cinnamon. Bought for ARS$110; great CxB easily one of the best options for a Cabernet Sauvignon at this price. Bodega Renacer produces great quality affordable wines.

It has beautiful ruby colour. Also has orange taste of sangiovese. Taste is mainly cavernet sauvignion. Comfortable acodoty, and Merlot gives nuance of soft and mild attack.

Very dark with ruby rim. Intense black fruit seasoned with pepper, coffee and vanilla. Medium to full body. Intense in flavor. Very pleasant with only gentle bitterness as tannins are at the perfect spot. Finish is very long. Another beautiful expression of Brazilian terroir and it tastes like you are drinking a wine 2 or 3 times de price. Hard to find due to small production but worths to look for.

Really quite nice, and clearly needs to breath some. Opened it yesterday and it was a little rough, still good, but much more alcoholic and strong green pepper taste in mouth. Today it's significantly smoother really quite nice light jammy flavors and the harshness of the green pepper is gone. Not sure it's a solid solid four, between a 3.5 and 4, but decided for the benefit of the doubt on this one.

In the mouth: ripe fruit, mango, melon, apricot, exotic fruit, some citrus and yellow apple, spice, vanilla whit oak accents, dry hay. Wine well balanced, smooth and fresh, with a full body and a nice texture. Finish: creamy-buttery.

Just sneaking in at 3.5. Gouveio 🇵🇹 blend. For those keeping score , ✅ Gouveio much more famous in NW Spain 🇪🇸 where known as Godello. This is a peachy little number with a mineral streak. Grapefruit finish. Acidity is medium. Missing some depth to the mid palate but does the trick with a chicken taco salad. Quaff away with this Portugal 🇵🇹 white.

Considering 2004 was one of Montalcino's best years ever, this did not disappoint at all. 12 years later it's in terrific form. Wonderful fruit and leather aroma; cherry, berry and earthy taste; beautiful balance and complex from start to finish; softened tannins made wine very drinkable and enjoyable.

Douro wines tasting meeting. #2- Organic wine* made of Touriga Nacional + Tour. Franc + Tinta Roriz grapes aged for 12 months in French oak barrels. Dark rubi red color. Intense red/black fruit and plum preserve aromas with notes of wood, spices, licorice, bitter chocolate and, lately, caramel. Medium-bodied (14.0%), well-balanced wine disclosing robust acidity and alcohol pairing strong, velvety tannins. Finish is intense, dry, smooth, delicious and persistent. 88-GB pts!! 👏👏 *Supposed to live up to 3-4 y.

This wine is quite a beast for the price. It is far more elegant than the name suggests. It feels velvety, and has gorgeous notes of black fruits and earth. Its description “an iron fist with a velvet glove” is apt. Incredibly smooth for the flavors present. Pairs great with meat.

Smoked berry fruit aromas, cherry coming though in the mouth ahead of a lightly spiced and engaging blackcurrant trailer, supportive tannins and a touch of black leather bringing up the rear. This is a versatile wine - can be enjoyed by itself but best with food and can take strongly flavoured dishes, even spiced.

(77/100) I've had much better, although this is a big Douro wine & subsequently would fair well from 5 years plus bottle ageing, alot of it's counterparts are drinking very well, very young, so it was a bit of a disappointment. A subtle bouquet of damson & blueberry are a pleasant start, but from the off this wine is more of an assault on the palate - lip smacking, almost overwhelming, rasping acidity, raw oaking, wayward grippy tannins & hugely boozy finish! Nose & palate couldn't be more different!

White Portuguese cork, same cork design as on the red version of the same wine. Simple art label with a “P” dominant and other wine info “hided” on the very upper left and right corners. It has a fruity summer alike nose. Refreshing palate, rather complex and staged, starts refreshing, then you feel some stone fruits, and in the end is rather sour, it is a blend of 3 Portuguese grapes (same ppl would argue about Verdelho), stays for quite awhile on the central mouth. It has some character, but complex.

3,75 for my first time with this Chilean Syrah. Today I actually believe that Syrahs are currently the best varietals from Chile, as I deslize the usual strong Eucalyptus tone if the Bordeaux grapes from there. This has full blackberries, plum and smoke nose and mouth. Not overly structured and not for long aging. A good mid week wine

4.3. This Syrah had a very intriguing nose of pine needles, mint, tobacco, very mature, possibly candied, strawberries, Hazelnut and chocolate. But I also perceived a subtle note of crudo as well as salty sea breeze with minerals. Once tasted it coated the mouth like a delicate curry, round and full and slightly spicy. Ripe blueberries and vainilla, with a nice, long, lingering finish. Please sir ... I want some more

Surrau have beautiful tasting rooms overlooking the vineyards, just inland from the Costa Smerelda. Sciala is their premium vermentino and it does the DOCG proud. Gentle, fresh, minerally nose of peach and apricot. Lees maturation produces a full flavoured, dry wine suffused with the local granite soils, that is a fantastic match for the Galluran food - seafood most obviously, but it happily rides with the Granglona cheese or bitter olives. The wine is moderate + acidity, a touch bitter too.

Very nice Primitivo:) Tongue is very deep, full of black cherries, blackberries, delicate tannins and vanilla mixed with acids. Nose is also very deep, blackberries and black cherries mixed with vanilla dominate here. Aftertaste is very long, blackberry and cherry jam mixed with alcohol and tannins are the most intensive here. Colour is very dark ruby. 3.9 note.

(4.3*) Confraria Moóca 29/07 - Blind tasting and of course was impossible match this 100% Petit Verdot. I was the big surprise of the night but looking for some information I discovered that this wine was named ""best wine from other grapes"" in 2015 by Descorchados. Aged for 14 months in French oak 50% new. Aromas of spices, flowers, black fruit as touches of strawberry and notes of minty licorice. The palate is powerful, with a nice acidity and flavors of tobacco and raspberries. Finished fruity. Thanks Ted

(4.3*) Quinta da Romaneira wine tasting. Full details on www.vaocubo.com In my opinion was the best of the afternoon. Fantastic Petit Verdot aged for 14 months in French oak. I love this grape and it's not easy to find great wines 100% PV. Deep purple in color with forest fruits aromas and cassis notes. On palate is smooth and rich with fruity tannins and flavors of blueberries, ginger and cedar. Finished fruity and very persistent.

Aromas of cherry, cassis, blueberry, blackcurrant, tobacco, gentle oak, spices and vanilla. On the palate good body, structured, complex, good acidity and freshness. Soft tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!!

Very nice Portuguese blend from Douro, a delicate, silver-gold color with warm straw reflexes. Nose: ripe yellow fruit, floral aromas, fresh herbs, vanilla and oak. In the mouth: ripe fruit, mango, melon, apricot, exotic fruit, some citrus and yellow apple, spice, vanilla whit oak accents, dry hay. Wine well balanced, smooth and fresh, with a full body and a nice texture. Finish: creamy-buttery.

Considering 2004 was one of Montalcino's best years ever, this did not disappoint at all. 12 years later it's in terrific form. Wonderful fruit and leather aroma; cherry, berry and earthy taste; beautiful balance and complex from start to finish; softened tannins made wine very drinkable and enjoyable.

Earth and leather in the nose with subdued black fruit. The wine is very smooth with grippy tannins and noticeable wants amounts of fruit. Earth comes through clearly accentuated by faint amounts of vanilla. Acidity is moderate and finishes cleanly.

Limited selection. Medium bodied wine with a black fruit, cherry and wood nose. Fruit flavours that are a little jammy with some hints of Bracken. Dry. I suppose for the age it is acceptable and the price in this high priced market is reasonable value.

Average wine with an extraordinary nose full of raspberries and blueberries. Tongue not really follows with some sour cherry, disintegrated alcohol and acidity. I’d dare to say the finish is overwhelmed by a mix of watery texture and some acids. Poor value for money.

Red with violet reflections. Raspberry, chemical and tabaco aromas. On the palate, soft and round tannins, medium bodied and it contains more alcohol than I was expectating. In a summary, it is good wine for its price!

Not bad. Citrus nose, with a hint of tangerine in with the obvious lemon, and some passion fruit notes. Loads of pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit and lime in the mouth, with the typical gooseberry bite and grassy backdrop you'd predict to find before even pouring it. Saline finish which offsets the acidity. A bit too sharp and eye watering for me though, and it is missing something towards the finish, but I can easily see people loving this wine.

Oh this is good! Smells amazing, prunes, raisins, and leather. What an all around beauty, she’s got a smooth velvety mouthfeel, a touch of sweetness, enough tannin to keep you happy and maybe even leaving you wanting more. All this with a long lingering finish that forces you to immediately take another sip.

A great blend of Petit Verdot, Carmenere, Cab Franc and Syrah. The unusual is that the predominant grape, 50%, is Petit Verdot. Think that it's a perfect blend that gives a strong wine, 14,5% in alcohol. Heavy body and balanced tannins.

45% Petit Verdot, 25% Syrah, 15% Cabernet Franc.... The aromas have dark fruit (raspberry, cassis and mulberry) written all over it followed by seams of cut grass and mushroom notes. In the mouth, the dark flavours continue. Ample licorice, peppery spice and kumquat come through in the mid palate. The tannins are dark and as heavy as the bottle. The Merlot and Carmenere (the remaining 15%) give the wine an acidity lift and a long and memorable finish. A harmonious combination of varietals.

3.3 stars maybe...But why waste life with drinking this kind of (for me) mediocre wine....? Because a friend suggested it. Review: a thin and spikey cab that really is anything but mature. It basically misses all that I look for in a wine. It goes down better with spicy food but still...why not pour it out and open a better bottle of something else. Or have a ""nice cup of tea"" instead. Just to give it a second chance, I am putting it into the fridge for a while. Update: better after fridge + 6 h decanting.

Enjoyable Bordeaux blend with Cabernet Sauvignon dominate. Aromas of dark fruits and plum, with similar tastes. Not overly complex or tannic, more of a table wine than one to lay down. Central Market tasting table.

Cherry, marinated plums, strawberry and notes of green gras. It's a good solid wine with a great structure and nice balance that lingers on the front palate. The berry flavours really shines through and gives this wine an edge which is highly enjoyable.

Here’s a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, black truffle , creamy vanilla oak and a balsamic note. The firm palate shows dried Morello cherries,baked fig and oak- driven spice alongside close- grained tannins.

This was really a topper yesterday evening. Half is made in the same way as Amarone , with dried grapes. The nose smells of ripe plums , tobacco, spice and black cherry . Fleshy, plump and elegant in the mouth but still a natural freshness . Sleek and sturdy tannin structure that guarantees a long and complex finish . Corvina , Rondinella and Corvinone grapes.

Hard to believe the Mencia grape was traditionally used for light and pale Spanish wines. Thankfully, current winemakers know better. This varietal has made a 180° turn. Inky dark ruby pour, with licorice on the nose. Smooth velvety notes of black fruit preserves, cola, and cocoa tickle your taste buds. Oak and vanilla linger in the finish. Aged 16 months in French oak; 18 months in bottle. Food friendly and not overpowering. Perfect with Teff Stew.

Mencia from Bierzo, very nice. Red and dark fruits, mostly cooked with some wood notes that rightly remain in the background. The tanins are still young but the wine is pleasant, full bodied while not heavy and with lots of fruity character. Nice !

The thing about a good mencía is that even the young wines have such richness in flavors that much oak is not really necessary (apart from adding complexity). This one is not extraordinary, but fits lovely with traditional Bierzo meals, in our case ""botillo"", with strong red fruits, blueberry and cherry notes, light acidity and balsamic pass through. 3,5 stars due to a very good quality-price ratio.

My wife asked me to open up a bottle from the cellar instead of an ""everyday"" bottle. I decided to open up a Barolo based upon a craving. I'm very pleased with my decision. Very nice nose of rose, strawberry, and earth. Palate of red fruit, cherry, strawberry and dusty earth. A beautiful garnet color in the glass with long legs and chewy tannins, this bottle really hit the spot and satisfied my craving. Still young and early in the drinking window, give this 3-5 years to really develop.

I tend to taste more of our carignan, carmenere, malbec and other more ‘exotic ‘ varietals, so our cabernet sauvignon has been somewhat overlooked by me. Mistake from my side. The 2010 is tasting beautifully with lots of red fruit, complexity and freshness. Wow. Drank the bottle in two sessions over two days...wine also has staying power. Good for at least another 5 years or more.

Intense dark ruby red colour with Very complex aromas of black and red fruits and fine shades of tertiary aromas like prunes, resins and balsamic. Full bodied, balanced with robust but well integrated tannins and refreshing acidity. Long, velvety and persistent finish. Can drink now but has a potential for aging.

Fairly citrusy and acidic with a long flavor on the palate. Would pair well with something spicy or something rich as the white can cut through and make a statement that complements the food.

A delicious example of this cultivar, will definitely be buying more Argentinian viognier in the future. A persistent nose of peachy aromas leads to earthy, woody, buttery peach flavours with a hint of minerality and a gorgeous mouthfeel.

This is outstanding white for a modest price! Pale yellow, very clear with fast tears. Not too fragrant but with interesting critic aromas and a bit of white fruits. It is a good food wine, pairs well with many things because it fresh and citric with good acidity. Very good white to pair with food, from fish to chicken and all sorts of white and sweet/sour sauces.

Sometimes you luck out with the $6 wine (R$22 here in Brazil via Vinho Fácil). Light and crisp (not your Cali Chard for sure) with just enough cream on the mouth feel. Paired excellently with a sesame crusted Salmon with a Passion Fruit sauce! QPR is. +.3-.5 on this 3.6-3.8 white.

Confraria Só Vinhos SP - 14/10 This wine was best of the night in my opinion. Made from Nebbiolo, aged for 24 months in Slovonian oak and 36 months ageing in the bottle, very elegant and tasty, dry and full-body, quity woody, aromas of plums, liquorice, leather and tobacco. Ripe tannins and notes of spices on palate, persistent and imposing. What a wine! Vintage 2006 can be kept for some more years.

Gave this Bordeaux a 🌪 in the aerator and it’s quite tasty for the price. Light and dry with flavorful notes of juicy cherry, cassis, and black licorice. Mild tannins keep the fruit front and center. Far from being heavy, it would pair well with warmer weather and outdoor dining. Think bbq. Now if I could only remember where I bought it! 🙄 3.2🌟

Mencia from Bierzo, very nice. Red and dark fruits, mostly cooked with some wood notes that rightly remain in the background. The tanins are still young but the wine is pleasant, full bodied while not heavy and with lots of fruity character. Nice !

The thing about a good mencía is that even the young wines have such richness in flavors that much oak is not really necessary (apart from adding complexity). This one is not extraordinary, but fits lovely with traditional Bierzo meals, in our case ""botillo"", with strong red fruits, blueberry and cherry notes, light acidity and balsamic pass through. 3,5 stars due to a very good quality-price ratio.

Delicious Primitivo, one of the greatest of 2016 wine meeting. Structured and equilibrated wine, mahogany color, awesome tobacco aroma, full bodied, excellent wine and it is easy to be drunk. Tobacco, plum and honey tasting notes, low acid level, medium alcoholic level, good tannin and long ending. Gorgeous example of a Primitivo.

3.3 stars maybe...But why waste life with drinking this kind of (for me) mediocre wine....? Because a friend suggested it. Review: a thin and spikey cab that really is anything but mature. It basically misses all that I look for in a wine. It goes down better with spicy food but still...why not pour it out and open a better bottle of something else. Or have a ""nice cup of tea"" instead. Just to give it a second chance, I am putting it into the fridge for a while. Update: better after fridge + 6 h decanting.

This was really a topper yesterday evening. Half is made in the same way as Amarone , with dried grapes. The nose smells of ripe plums , tobacco, spice and black cherry . Fleshy, plump and elegant in the mouth but still a natural freshness . Sleek and sturdy tannin structure that guarantees a long and complex finish . Corvina , Rondinella and Corvinone grapes.

Hard to believe the Mencia grape was traditionally used for light and pale Spanish wines. Thankfully, current winemakers know better. This varietal has made a 180° turn. Inky dark ruby pour, with licorice on the nose. Smooth velvety notes of black fruit preserves, cola, and cocoa tickle your taste buds. Oak and vanilla linger in the finish. Aged 16 months in French oak; 18 months in bottle. Food friendly and not overpowering. Perfect with Teff Stew.

As it was my second Chardonnay at all I'm trying to not overrate it but I liked it very much as an aperitif and ofcourse with fish. Fruity on the nose and smooth but still with character on the palate. Value for your money!

A great blend of Petit Verdot, Carmenere, Cab Franc and Syrah. The unusual is that the predominant grape, 50%, is Petit Verdot. Think that it's a perfect blend that gives a strong wine, 14,5% in alcohol. Heavy body and balanced tannins.

45% Petit Verdot, 25% Syrah, 15% Cabernet Franc.... The aromas have dark fruit (raspberry, cassis and mulberry) written all over it followed by seams of cut grass and mushroom notes. In the mouth, the dark flavours continue. Ample licorice, peppery spice and kumquat come through in the mid palate. The tannins are dark and as heavy as the bottle. The Merlot and Carmenere (the remaining 15%) give the wine an acidity lift and a long and memorable finish. A harmonious combination of varietals.

Age has finally started to show on this Rosso—clear ruby ruby with nuances of garnet. The nose is elegantly perfumed with aromas of red cherries, ripe strawberries, and hints of cedar, some spice. Dry on the mouth with medium acid and mellow tannins, both of which starting to integrate fully on every sip. The palate is lush with flavours of ripe red fruit and tart raspberries. Tertiary notes of tobacco and leather are also expressed. Overall medium body with very good length. Good value.

(3.7*) Casa Sagres wine tasting. This wine is an excellent choice for a very nice Primitivo under R$90. Grapes for Manduria, aged for 6 months in oak, good balanced and very elegant. Ruby-red color, aromas of sweet spices, tobacco, vanilla and licorice. On palate is smooth and medium body with sweet tannins and flavors of dried fruits, prune, balsamic notes and cloves. Finished velvety with a very good aftertaste. Potential to improve.

93/100 REAL BIO 4000 bottles produced. Same wine of Cocciapazza but at the time to rack it from the fermentation vat to the oak Mazzamurello is the last 25% on the vat including the lees Spend 20 months in 50% new oak from different French forests. Same TN of Cocciapazza but the vanilla is more marked and cacao become chocolate here Full body High acidity High ripe tannins High alcohol 14.5% Pronounced intensity Long finish Acidity more detectable on palate thanks to the riper tannins soften by the lees

Delicious, Montepulciano, with a very dark ruby-red color with carmine reflexes. Nose: heavy, aromatic, rustic, skin, spices, herbs, animal accents, earthy notes, forest mulch, silage. In the mouth: very ripe fruits, plums, chokeberry, hawthorn, herbaceous nuances and the power of forest notes, earthy. Wine, tart, with a powerful structure, smooth but clear tannins, juicy fruit acidity, with a very long finish, and mocha aftertaste.

Very good wine - smooth and quite mild, a lot of cherries and dried red fruits on the nose, the body is not so full as 13' had with the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity, tannins are moderate. The problem is that I had it together with Dante Marramiero 98', the real ""other wine killer"" as after it all other stuffs sound like empty compotes. Or - maybe - it's still very young and will improve seriously in a year or two. Anyway it's very good wine - recommend!

The Bricco Luciani vineyard is one of the lowest in La Morra, at around 200m elevation. It is close to the Barolo Alba road and the commune boundary with Castiglione Falletto. The locals say that you can drink La Morra from it’s 7th birthday, which is younger than I’m used to. They seem to be right, even from a more backward vintage like 2012, although part of the secret is the local food. Rich black cherry fruit, rose, balsamic, spice. Remarkably generous and soft on the palate. Not much complexity yet.

A great second wine that looks first. A fantastic year for Margaux. Needs 90 minutes to open up. Made with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. Aged for 12 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, cassis, raspberry, blueberry, sweet spices, oak and licorice. On the palate medium body, structured, well balanced, good complexity and acidity. Polished tannins. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

This is s beauty. After 30 minutes open, the flavors explode. Smoke and and raspberry one the nose. The structure is classic warm south Australia old vines, grainy fruit, cherries, tannins, meaty, earth. All bundled together in a palate seducing bundle. Magnificent wine. I bet it wont peak for a little while yet.

Strangers in the Halloween night. Portuguese blend of local red varieties that are of course total strangers to me. It's probably my second wine ewer from Portugal. Aromas were quite light black berries and on a palate plastic side taste that developed to leather perhaps. Oak and plenty of tannins. Yeah, felt too dry first. Interesting, somewhat different experience.

Rich, elegant and complex aromas of lime, wax and light diesel. (That kind of “diesel” that smells nothing like diesel, but we all agree that on wine, it’s “diesel”). High acidity with some residual sugar. Rich lime on the palate with stone minerality Long finish. Great expression of the style.

This Riesling is a mineral wine with a delicious floral flavor and a good balance. The Kaiton gives a delicious delight in the mouth and you taste fresh fruit. We were on the vineyard last year and drank the Kaiton from older years. The older wines ware beautiful. So the wine can be kept for many years. And that we will do.

A lovely modern, fruit-forward blend of Grenache, Syrah, Carignan & Mourvèdre. No oak, just a pure expressive blast of Southern French fruit. Med ruby. M+ aroma intensity w. plump plum, raspberry & cherry. A touch of smoky earthiness & youthful exuberance of ripe black cherry & faint leathery polish. Dry. Silky smooth, velvety w. ripe, generous black cherry, raspberry, black plum & wild strawberry. An underlayer of garrigue spice & earthy richness. Med fine tannins, med acid & a med finish.

3,75 - Beautiful blend of Grenache, Carignan, Syrah and Cinsault, very well balanced between the power and roundness of Grenache, spices of Syrah, freshness of Carignan and light fruity and floral aromas of Cinsault. Dark cherries, little red berries, cinnamon, pepper. This could be described as an easy drinking ""Vin de Soif"" with more texture and a nice silky and elegant finish.

What a nice PQR! This deeply ruby RdD has delicious fragrances of prunes, ripe brambles, black cherries combined with spicy notes of cloves, cinnamon, pimento and vanilla. The medium high acidity is well balanced with the slightly off-dry taste. The complexity and the medium plus tannin structure promise further aging potential. Overall already a harmonious wine with a long finish. A rebuy. (86 P)

A lovely modern, fruit-forward blend of Grenache, Syrah, Carignan & Mourvèdre. No oak, just a pure expressive blast of Southern French fruit. Med ruby. M+ aroma intensity w. plump plum, raspberry & cherry. A touch of smoky earthiness & youthful exuberance of ripe black cherry & faint leathery polish. Dry. Silky smooth, velvety w. ripe, generous black cherry, raspberry, black plum & wild strawberry. An underlayer of garrigue spice & earthy richness. Med fine tannins, med acid & a med finish. A great quaff!

3,75 - Beautiful blend of Grenache, Carignan, Syrah and Cinsault, very well balanced between the power and roundness of Grenache, spices of Syrah, freshness of Carignan and light fruity and floral aromas of Cinsault. Dark cherries, little red berries, cinnamon, pepper. This could be described as an easy drinking ""Vin de Soif"" with more texture and a nice silky and elegant finish.

Marzipan, Young tannins. Sligthly too sharp. Good now, but will improve after aging. If you don't have the patience for that, decanter it for a few hours

This desert wine convinced me with its character. It seduces you with it's fullness, but manages to stay delicate. In the nose you can smell some petrol, orange and peach, which corresponds with a delightful lightness/freshness in the taste. Great to end the night with something uplifting :)

What a nice PQR! This deeply ruby RdD has delicious fragrances of prunes, ripe brambles, black cherries combined with spicy notes of cloves, cinnamon, pimento and vanilla. The medium high acidity is well balanced with the slightly off-dry taste. The complexity and the medium plus tannin structure promise further aging potential. Overall already a harmonious wine with a long finish. A rebuy. (86 P)

Round 2 of this @puertaAmerica tasting was this Parada de Atauta that my friend Joaquin enjoys so much! Ruby with some violet hints, medium intensity, nice brightness. The nose has aromas of mint together with red fruit and cedar notes. The mouth is dry, marked tannins, mid acidity with a mid-body support. Finish is very toffee alike, some anises and nice toasted! Great value, very pleasant!!!

I'd give it almost a 4.0 For $7.99 at Trader Joe's, it's a bargain and what you expect in a Marlborough Sauv Blanc. It is our house white wine, and I buy it by the case. Like most Sauvignon Blancs, it is perishable and never as good the next day after opening. Drink now and enjoy.

Arinto is usually used in Vinho Verde blend to provide acidity, but I might aswell try this monovarietal wine. Explosion of pear, wet stones and cantaloupe on the nose. Stingy lime citrus palate. Ends floral and mineralic. Some will claim it is ubalanced, but I think it's allright. I'm not thriving for the bitter element that is clearly missing. Enjoyable.

First toasted coffee and spicy flavours appear, than vanilla, blackthorn and black currrant leaf. Palate of soft texture with firm and rounded tannins and hints of blackthorns, chokeberry, wild cherry. Long and pleasant aftertaste, thorn/chokeberry plus lingonberry nuances.

92 Points, drink now until 2022. Deep ruby with small rims. Complex nose of black berries, cherry, tobacco leaves and leather carrying bitter chocolate. Balance is slightly out of the angles due to high acidity, but besides this very balanced and good with food. Full bodied and finishing medium, slightly drying out with a mouth full of tannins.

THIS WINE REALLY EXCITES ME!! This is the same house that makes Lynch-Bauges red, and Jean-Michel did a great job on this one! This is for wine lovers looking for casual enjoyment with style & quality! This is 100% Sauv Blanc for those looking, with no cat pee! Scents of grapefruit, gooseberry & minerals lead to flavors of lime & honeydew. Softer and more plush than the NZ version, I think a few years will really elevate this bottle well beyond its price point!

100% Monastrell. Good wine! 13% ABV; a bit overpowering but after a while it gets tolerable. Acidity is balanced. Produced by GLM Wines; Gabriel Martínez is the author. D.O.P. Jumilla; established in 1966. Aged for 3 months in French and American oak. Medium purple color with a garnet touch. Agglomerate cork; bad kind. Flavors: coffee, plum, pepper, light cinnamon and oak. Aromas: blackberry, oak, toast, lavender. Bought on sale at WineBR for R$18,61; amazing CxB, wouldn’t buy if it was more than R$30

The grapes were sourced from selected cool climate vineyards in Elgin, Darling and Cape Agulhas, fermented in oak, and spent six months on their lees. The wine is very fresh, much fresher than you would think based on the winemaking techniques. Plenty of lemon aromas and flavors, mouthfeel, and finishing with abundant acids.

Good smooth and smokey cabernet from ZA. Well balanced aromatic fruity style. Good balanced to the grilled lamb chops with tarragon sauce and french fries.

Like a teenage boy's room, it takes a good few hours of airing before it is worth engaging with. But once you're in there, there is all manner of intriguing tidbits. Aromas include menthol, cassis, leather & oaky vanilla. On the palate, gentle cassis & rich oak sing a duet, while some fairly juicy tannins play bongos in the background. 3.5 stars with 1/2 a star for great value (R89.00 per bottle)

1999 is a great Vintage & this wine is exceptionally well priced. Deep dark colour. Soft nose. Body is is silky smooth. Ripe red fruits and earthy flavours fill your palate. Medium, clean finish. Highly recommended.

Crafted with Chardonnay and Viognier varieties, this specimen is produced in one of the largest wine-growing regions in Brazil, the Campanha Gaúcha. Easy to drink and harmonize. It has a light straw yellow color, with green reflections, clear and bright. Aromas of medium intensity, reminding white fruit such as apple and peach, light buttery, delicate floral. Good acidity, is a light and pleasant wine, with great freshness.

Perfectly fine and good with a mix of Brazilian dishes, including squid and a traditional beef dish (feijoada). Minerally start, in a Riesling way. Some lime. Apple? Melon? Apricots? We'd need another bottle to be sure.

Vintage 2014: berries in the nose (blackberry, strawberry, blueberry) with a little oak. A velvety smooth feeling in the mouth. The berries taking the lead with the oak as a modest background vocal finishing the ensemble. Some might prefer the berries to be a bit more modest... but this will go perfect with game (eg sweet venison). Outstanding price / quality

This is the best carmenere I ever tasted. And that's because it tastes exactly like merlot. No wonder they thought for so long carmenere WAS in fact merlot. Carmenere was one of the grapes eradicated in Europe by filoxera. When imported to Chile, it was mixed up with and vinificated as Merlot till 94, when genetic tests proved it was the thought extinct Carmenere. Now no grape represents Chilean wine as this one.

A good value Chardonnay. Bridlewood is consistent with both its whites and reds. Apple tart and french barrel oak on the nose, creamy and buttery, straw color, low to medium body, easy drinking, citric and fresh palate, and a pleasant vanilla finish. A wine with aging potential, the oak influence is balanced and not overbearing.

(4.1) This is a good wine. For sure will will buy again. Blend 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Franc aged for 12 months in French oak and will good volume and nice body. Aromas of black fruits, currants, tobacco and a spice touch. On palate is firm with ripe tannins and perfect balance, full-body and flavors of dark chocolate, toasted notes and cinnamon. Finished smooth with long persistent and a ripe aftertaste. Highly recommended my friends.

Enjoyable wine, haven't tried many spanish wine, but this one is quite allright. Light red colour and a very fruity nose. Taste is perhaps a little mild for my taste, but it is very fruity and does not scare anyone away with too much alcohol in the taste. Very pleasent to enjoy both at dinner and alone with a good movie.

The grapes were sourced from selected cool climate vineyards in Elgin, Darling and Cape Agulhas, fermented in oak, and spent six months on their lees. The wine is very fresh, much fresher than you would think based on the winemaking techniques. Plenty of lemon aromas and flavors, mouthfeel, and finishing with abundant acids.

Vintage 2014: berries in the nose (blackberry, strawberry, blueberry) with a little oak. A velvety smooth feeling in the mouth. The berries taking the lead with the oak as a modest background vocal finishing the ensemble. Some might prefer the berries to be a bit more modest... but this will go perfect with game (eg sweet venison). Outstanding price / quality

Natureo is natural semisweet white made of Muscat, with residual spirit content of 0.5%. Pale golden colored, it shows distinct Muscat fragrances, hinted by wild white flowers, honey, white peach. Palate: obviously angular in terms of alcohol content, with light excess of sweetness. Flavors of yellow plum, pear, pippin apples and green gooseberry. Finish is sweet and acidic somehow. Wouldn't recommend it in usual life, but if you have any restrictions on alcohol - should be ok as substitution. 2.8*

Plush, earthy with lifted sweet red cherry on the nose and palate. Good value packs with flavours though finish is a tad short. Vibrant aromas of red cherry, black fruit, earth and hint of coffee.

Enjoyable wine, haven't tried many spanish wine, but this one is quite allright. Light red colour and a very fruity nose. Taste is perhaps a little mild for my taste, but it is very fruity and does not scare anyone away with too much alcohol in the taste. Very pleasent to enjoy both at dinner and alone with a good movie.

What a nice color out of the bottle. Deep, dark purple color with red rim. The nose is not that pretty right out of the bottle, but after it opens up it has a Beautiful fruity nose with blueberries, blackberries, mocha and figs. Gorgeous, big, full and bold. 14.5% alcohol by volume, gives it that oomph On the mid palate without much notice at the finish. Not too fruity at all, but plenty for me. Smooth and dry long finish with tannins that complement the spice at the finish.

THIS WINE REALLY EXCITES ME!! This is the same house that makes Lynch-Bauges red, and Jean-Michel did a great job on this one! This is for wine lovers looking for casual enjoyment with style & quality! This is 100% Sauv Blanc for those looking, with no cat pee! Scents of grapefruit, gooseberry & minerals lead to flavors of lime & honeydew. Softer and more plush than the NZ version, I think a few years will really elevate this bottle well beyond its price point!

Impressive. So much better than the average North Italian PG for the same price... A crisp and refined nose with impressions of a fresh mountain stream; wet stones, white blossom, apple. On the palate med+. A slight petille, mineral tones, a mild green apple and some floral impressions. Good balance and a nice med+ finish. May be the exceptional vintage, but this is really good! 15 pts. Do not serve too cold! At approx. 14 degrees it performs best to my opinion.

Slight spicy woodsmoke aromas, juicy red berry fruits in the mouth but difficult to identify individual flavours - it’s good but nothing particularly stands out. Ends with a little peep of cherry over obvious tannins and the finish isn’t lengthy so it’s all over in a hurry. Not too bad though all in all and looks like another great value red!

Old world understatement after a run of new world crowd pleasers. Not knocking my socks off, but I do have a soft spot for Portuguese. Maybe the contrast with their neighbours attracts me towards them. Fairly simple. Honest. Rustic. Deep flavours. A fantastic holiday red that you bring home and say “well, maybe you just had to be there”. But here in the BA lounge where there’s a permanent imprint of my bum by the wine station, it’s still enjoyable.

Giving this 100% Chardonnay a generous 4* for its generosity in richness at its price point. A relative new spin-off range by Ventisquero, this 'entry' is filled with savory tropical fruits, ripe pineapple and citrus. Fruity on palate too. Quite a dry white. Medium body with a nice thirst quenching acidity and clean finishing. An excellent all-rounder at its price

Very dark purple colour. Chocolate and black cherry nose. Overripe red plums, raspberry and rhubarb palate. My first Brazilian wine. Correct, but a bit boring.

Quite a good wine with a mineral taste and a tiny hint of acidity at the very end. Really soft bodied, quite a refreshing wine. Floral notes and a nice yellow pale color. Easy drinking wine, one of those to drink on a cool day after work ;)

Good smooth and smokey cabernet from ZA. Well balanced aromatic fruity style. Good balanced to the grilled lamb chops with tarragon sauce and french fries.

Like a teenage boy's room, it takes a good few hours of airing before it is worth engaging with. But once you're in there, there is all manner of intriguing tidbits. Aromas include menthol, cassis, leather & oaky vanilla. On the palate, gentle cassis & rich oak sing a duet, while some fairly juicy tannins play bongos in the background. 3.5 stars with 1/2 a star for great value (R89.00 per bottle)

Crafted with Chardonnay and Viognier varieties, this specimen is produced in one of the largest wine-growing regions in Brazil, the Campanha Gaúcha. Easy to drink and harmonize. It has a light straw yellow color, with green reflections, clear and bright. Aromas of medium intensity, reminding white fruit such as apple and peach, light buttery, delicate floral. Good acidity, is a light and pleasant wine, with great freshness.

Perfectly fine and good with a mix of Brazilian dishes, including squid and a traditional beef dish (feijoada). Minerally start, in a Riesling way. Some lime. Apple? Melon? Apricots? We'd need another bottle to be sure.

It's the first time I see a Misiones D'Rengo in the wine alleys, talking to one of the clerks I found out it seems to be a new introduced bottle in the alleys here in DR. Curious, I decided to try this one tonight at home. Went with the Merlot since I tend to spend time with people who enjoy Cabs more regularly when drinking New World Wines. Dark ruby colored, garnet perhaps. Aromas of forest berries, cloves. Full bodied, fruity, blackberry; well rounded, velvety, dry and acidic with a pleasant long finish.

A taste of Italy Inspired by Liliana's post this week, I was craving for some minestrone, so today I made our family version of it, with black beans and smoked ham, so what would be better than SANGIOVESE to go with? This varietal is crimson red with brick colored rims, nice nose with a predominance of flowers (rose and violet), good berry taste in a medium body, high acidity and crisp tannins. Feels like a small batch made Italian table wine, like my grandfather did many years ago, tastes like home.

I prefer Gallo's Signature Series Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir with some age on it—the 2013 offers up a bouquet of that is more dark fruited than red. Blackberries at peak ripeness, a touch of black cherry, vanilla and cola precede a wine that is swathed in fine, velvety tannins. This is a richer, more somber expression of Pinot Noir, one that is lifted by a well-placed vein of acidity and an alluring wisp of pink peppercorn. 14.7% ABV | Sample

I'm becoming a fan of this winery even after tasting just a couple of wines. This was a tasty treat and a real bargain at the same time. The one criticism we came up was that it was much lighter in body than we had expected. That's not all bad, of course, as it provides for more options for food pairings. Comprised of 60% Grenache, 35% Carignan, 2% Merlot, 2% Syrah, and 2% Ull de Llebre (Tempranillo). just $12.

Full bodied with equally bold spices that keep with a smooth texture. The dark fruit (blackberry and black cherry) remains framed in a lighter, smokey oak framework while cloves and very prominent amounts of sage expands on the palate and the nose. Good depth with layers of leather and mocha evolving. Just a nicely balanced Syrah... and the price point is awesome! Under $20 if you believe that! Extra half star on that note alone!

Pleasant notes of melon, pineapple and sweet honey with just the tiniest hint of oak. On the palate - pineapple and red apple. The finish is crisp. Not setting the world alight, but for £5, who's complaining???

100% Monastrell. Good wine! 13% ABV; a bit overpowering but after a while it gets tolerable. Acidity is balanced. Produced by GLM Wines; Gabriel Martínez is the author. D.O.P. Jumilla; established in 1966. Aged for 3 months in French and American oak. Medium purple color with a garnet touch. Agglomerate cork; bad kind. Flavors: coffee, plum, pepper, light cinnamon and oak. Aromas: blackberry, oak, toast, lavender. Bought on sale at WineBR for R$18,61; amazing CxB, wouldn’t buy if it was more than R$30

(4.1*) Vertical Tasting of Bo Bó Trapezio 2009 to 2012 with Haroldo Rodrigues, José Eduardo and Carlos S. This one had the biggest evolution during our tasting. Get really better after opened for 2 hours. On this vintage is a blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Franc aged for 18 months in oak with 14,0% abv. Dark red color, aromas of black cherries and cassis with notes of menthol. On palate is mineral with flavors of cedar, eucalyptus and vanilla. Persistent finish. In my opinion tied on second place.

BBQ Beaujolais #1 Light and fresh! Fleurie is called the queen of Beaujolais and it sure feels pretty and complex like a lady! Ruby red with fast and thin tears, flowery nose with some strawberry and crushed pepper. Light bodied with silky, low tannins that match meat and potato salad, no distinction! It is a wine of nuances, nothing in your face. Very elegant with good acidity. Finish is clean and reminiscent of flowers.

First go at Refosco and very impressed. Tannins still quite prominent but the apparently typical flowery nose is coming across delightfully. Having as much fun sniffing as sipping. Powerful on the palate but very slight chilling helps reveal details that room temperature hides. So deserving of Decanter's high praise.

This is a fantastically interesting Pinot Noir - very light with high acidity that keeps the tongue clean without being too dry and isn’t too sharp. The nose reminds me of a friend’s cigar box, the attack has lots of strawberry and raspberry whilst the finish has plum and blackberry.

I love this wine. I've become a big fan of Chilean Cabs and Cab blends this past year. You can find really nice reds for under $20 that outperform, in my opinion, many other reds in the same price category from other countries. I have to admit that I did like the '08 a little more, but I'm hoping another year or two will improve this '09. 70% Cab Sauv, 25% Merlot, and 5% Syrah.

4.2 Outstanding wine for the price year after year. Thyme, blackberry, black cherry, and a touch of vanilla. Silky smooth on the palate. This is a crowd pleaser.

Full bodied with equally bold spices that keep with a smooth texture. The dark fruit (blackberry and black cherry) remains framed in a lighter, smokey oak framework while cloves and very prominent amounts of sage expands on the palate and the nose. Good depth with layers of leather and mocha evolving. Just a nicely balanced Syrah... and the price point is awesome! Under $20 if you believe that! Extra half star on that note alone!

( 3,7 ) Very good wine tasted at the Wine Portugal Event 2018. Made with Touriga Nacional, Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet. Aged for 12 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate, oak, mint, spices and floral. On the palate medium + body. Soft tannins. Ends with good persistence. I recommend!

A high octane (13.5%) Dão white. Fatty fleshy stone fruit aromas. Full bodied. Light salinity leaning towards savoury. Mellow underlying fruitiness. Alcohol sits a little high. Great and harmonious with salty creamy risotto.

This is the newest vintage of the red blend made of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is still young: quite closed nose but already pleasant on the palate. I think it's going to be better in three years: 2019.

Dark and almost sinister in colour, it's a wine needing time and almost dedication. A complex nose with notes of leather, moss, sun drenched rocks, cedar wood, and violets. Gradually opening to reveal dark red fruits and plums. Very filling taste experience with prevalent tannins, ripe red fruits, something floral and almost peaty. A perfect companion for a good roast or steak. Leave in glass for at least 15 minutes and experience a marked change. Enjoy.

(3.3) A blend of 3 local Portugese grapes (Rabigato, Codega do Larinho and Viosinho). Perfumed nose with scents of blossoms, rose petals, lychee and Muscat grapes. Easy to mistake this for Muscat. Very juicy wine with medium acidity and maybe a bit one dimensional, but if you serve it very fresh it works well as an aperitif in this hot weather!

You can find really nice reds for under $20 that outperform, in my opinion, many other reds in the same price category from other countries. I have to admit that I did like the '08 a little more, but I'm hoping another year or two will improve this '09. 70% Cab Sauv, 25% Merlot, and 5% Syrah.

A fascinating wine. On the initial taste, it reminds of Blackjack and Fruit Salad sweets... A real richness. Later there is aniseed and tobacco with good oak and nice acidity. The aftertaste is more fruit dominated with blackberry, raspberry and plum.

This is the newest vintage of the red blend made of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. It is still young: quite closed nose but already pleasant on the palate. I think it's going to be better in three years: 2019.

A gorgeous night wine tasting @LaVinoteca, Viña del Mar, brought us this charming Syrah PQP. 12 years old vines planted in red clay & decomposed granite -located at the westernmost and coldest slopes of CdB vineyard- gave life to this delightful red, 14.9 Abv, that was kept 11 months in French oak barrels, 45% new, plus 6 months more bottle-stowed with a total production of just 6000 bottles. A cute dark crimson colour hides a seductive and wrapping bouquet having predominant notes of currant, violet >>>

Spanish wine drank at ""Boca Maldita"" group monthly meeting. Dark rubi red color. Moderate intensity black and red fruit aromas, with notes of minerals, herbs, oak and toasted coffee. Medium-bodied (14.0%), almost well-balanced wine with intense and proper acidity and alcohol, both quite well counterbalanced by nice, rounded tannins, leaving a quite smooth, slightly sweet and persistent finish. An 86-GB pts wine.

This is my second vintage of this label. Last year was a bit more vegetal and bittersweet. It seems to me like they got a better harvest this year as the fruit was more concentrated. I like the producer alot and the way he plays around. This is obviously something I consider worth buying as it has its own character. Yellow apples, candied lichi and vegetal tones. The profile is the same as '13 but as I mentioned, the balance between the fruit and the vegetal touch is encouraging and better this vintage.

Putting aside value for money, this cracker of an Argie Malbec is a worthy 3.5 stars. Picking it up for €10, if this was a value for money review, pushes it to 4 stars and higher. Easily outshines Argie and other new & old world reds selling for closer to €20. If it tastes this good for 2015 vintage, then I suspect the generous tannins will see this red mature in the bottle for another 5 years. Hence I am heading back to buy a case of this luscious, chocolatly, complex, deep plum number tomorrow.

A near perfect introduction to Langhe Nebbiolo. Ripe red fruits, including pure cherry, strawberry, and cranberry, begin, while some spice and cedar notes plays second fiddle harmoniously. A whisper of violet hangs like a dream. The palate begins smooth with an acid-driven core taking control into the firm tannins that conclude. Authentic. Pure. Excellent.

A gorgeous night wine tasting @LaVinoteca, Viña del Mar, brought us this charming Syrah PQP. 12 years old vines planted in red clay & decomposed granite -located at the westernmost and coldest slopes of CdB vineyard- gave life to this delightful red, 14.9 Abv, that was kept 11 months in French oak barrels, 45% new, plus 6 months more bottle-stowed with a total production of just 6000 bottles. A cute dark crimson colour hides a seductive and wrapping bouquet having predominant notes of currant, violet >>>

Medium body, dark ruby color, slightly alcoholic, leather, rich and sonorous (if given air), roasted textures of dark cherry, mild spice in the background, slight earthiness playing with acid on the finish. An even, fairly well developed wine at a great value price. Not bold or ballsy, but not shy or lacking identity either.

Another Spanish varietal favorite of mine is Monastrell better known as Mourvèdre in France but this proud grape's roots are in España. Deep purple. Developing aromas of blackberries, underbrush and spicy oak. Astringent tannins attack one's gums with high acidity and dollops of dark cocoa and black fruits, masking its 15% ABV. This is an unabashedly sweltering young brute all the way to a long finish. Not for the faint of heart. Tasted blind, I guessed Toro. I'd age this beast a few years. Good QPR.

Ruby-red color, aromas of ripe red fruits and herbaceous notes with hints of vanilla, hazelnut and chocolate. On palate is fresh with good acidity and impressive balance for only 8 months in oak. Flavors of chocolate, cedar, spices and cocoa. Finished with good persistence and nice aftertaste.

Ruby to purple colored with thin garnet rim. High viscosity; 13.1% alc. Cedar with dried prunes and smoke on nose. Mildly fruit forward on a balanced palate. Silky tannins. Short finish- barely noticable, with mocha. Easy and smooth overall, but nothing to seize on either. For immediate drinking. Pretty hot, but dryer than your average Merlot. Clearly something the winer tried to do - fermenting more sugars up. Made it pretty nice, so extra points for that.

Dark but pale ruby red color with nice aromas of ripe black fruits, smoke, and strong sweet herbs. Medium-to-full-bodied with fantastic taste of ripe black cherry, mulberry, black pepper, and load of sweet spices like holy basil. Bright acidity, fine tannins, and nice spicy finish. Feel like Neo-Spanish wine. Good value & Like it.

Thanks to Kristel Balcaen for introducing this Malbec sparkling rosé made by Ernesto, the ""bohemian"" son of Nicolás Zapata. He is apparently bringing different styles to Argentinian wine. Malcec from about 1k m altitude Vistaflores vineyard, traditional method crianza (1yr each in oak&bottle) 12mths on lees. Nose: light yeasty brioche. Palate: initially a bit high dosage with apples, but the ginger+green bitterness from skin contact create a pleasant balance. Slight oxidation. Caramel+apricot finish.

(3.8*) Wine Weekend 2017. My favorite Argentinean blend, Malbec (65%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) aged for 8 months in French oak with 14,5% abv. Ruby-red color, aromas of ripe red fruits and herbaceous notes with hints of vanilla, hazelnut and chocolate. On palate is fresh with good acidity and impressive balance for only 8 months in oak. Flavors of chocolate, cedar, spices and cocoa. Finished with good persistence and nice aftertaste.

Complex nose of mature dark fruits as raspberries and plum, secondary of spices and herbs with subtile wet soil and leather. In mouth, medium body, rounded up tanins amd juicy flavours leaving a persistant and lovely aftertaste! Cheers!

This one caused dual feelings: on the one hand it went quite well with red meat, and you could find high tannins and berries in it. But on the other hand it turned out to be quite young, without distinct taste, with lack of authenticity as I call it and lack of identity. Maybe one should let it raise a little bit and in a couple of years it will be better. But that's all IMHO, so maybe you will be pleased more than me. Enjoy!

Interesting to put side-by-side with the Musar... a serious hefty one from Ksara and very nice indeed. A bit of a sweetish finish, the way Priorat is often sweet.

Very nice and clear gold yellow color with beautiful bright golden reflexes. Nice and intense floral and citric aromas with hints of sweet pineapple preserve and honey. Medium-bodied and well-balanced Chilean white wine, crisp, mineral and sweet in the mouth with proper acid and alcohol content. Drank in the business class flight in my retun to Rio from Miami. An 86-88 pts wine.

3.5 not much characters but in a good harmony. Not really an aromatic wine compared with other Chilean white although it's from a cooler region of Chile The same goes for the palate. However its soft acidity matches the fruitiness perfectly making this bottle super smooth and easy drinking. Decent white for you who just enter the world and the hot summer.

Very balanced initially almost oddly devoid of taste.After a minute or two it registers as a non acidic, but rich bodied wine. Give this wine time to open, it blossoms into a complex smooth wine with notes of golden apple and white cherry. A very interesting white with a color that resembles good scotch.

Delicious and finesse, a very good value for money, one of the best Douro Touriga Nacional - This wine shows a different character. With origins in old vineyards Valley Mendiz, with 50 to 70 years old, the novelty is the combination with a percentage of Touriga Nacional from Quinta do Sibio. Very concentrated in color. Very expressive and elegant aroma dominated by notes of wild berries and cistus well combined with wood. The palate is full and balanced, very silky, fresh and intense. Final greatly extended

100% Loureiro from granitic soils in Vinho Verde (Lima). Tangerine, Citrus, prairie flowers, fresh herbs like thyme. Palate is soft and delicate, full of citrus flavours. No complexity, but a lot of freshness (and low alcohol profile : only 10.0 %) for this very easy white. Good quality price ratio. 13/20.

Allmost 4 stars.. In the glass a bright straw yellow color with golden reflections. On the nose delicate aromas of apple, grapefruit, citrus and flowers with nice hints of honey and spices. On the palate dry, medium-bodied and well balanced. The mouthfeel is round and light waxy with nice soft acidity and mineral notes. Tasting peach, apricot, light cedar and honey and a good persistence. The finish is full of fruit and has a nice length.

Dark berries and overtone of alcohol in the nose. A bit sharp in the palate. Tries with a chocolate smooth finish - but it doesn't quite work.

This is surprisingly good, a blend of tinta(s) roriz, national & franca from old vines. Aromas of cassis, boysenberry, tobacco leaf & old leather. The palate is complemented by blueberry, black pepper and wild mushrooms. Love that it’s only 12.5% abv but still full of loads of depth & complexity.

Dec. 2018 @Shangri-La, Cebu Excellent! This Chilean Sauvignon Blanc is like a hidden gem. It is not very grass nuance just like famous Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. But it was very light and fresh flavor with pleasing lighter asian pear notes with little bit of flowery scents. Most of all, This white wine is pushing magnificent graphite notes. It was very refreshing specially with white-green salads. Recommendable!

Excellent wine tasting at the Rubaiyat Restaurant at the Caballo Loco Event. The name is a tribute to one of the owners, Jorge Coderch whose nickname is Crazy Horse. Made with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Carmenere and 5% Malbec. Aged for 18 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate, tobacco, spices, vanilla and mineral. On the palate good body, structured, good complexity and acidity. Soft tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!!

Gorgeous nose hints of African spices and cumin. Once drank it's smooth and seductive, with mystery and sensuality. There's no single flavor that dominates but instead it slowly reveals different colors as you enjoy the glass: licorice, currant, and is that pumpkin? Would pare well with a bold spicy soup as well as the traditional red meat plate. Highly recommended.

Really nice light ruby coloring. This would be a 4.5 if the aroma was slightly softer. But, it’s lots of concrete and musk and I’m not a big fan. The palette is great though. Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple on front. Then some sour cherry ending in lime. Tough to find a Pinot Noir I prefer at this price point.

Mendocino varietal wine made of Chardonnay grapes that were aged for 12 months in oak barrels. Clear and brilliant straw yellow color with golden reflexes. Very intense and elegant white and yellow fruit aromas with notes of butter, vanilla, minerals and honey. Medium-bodied (13.9%) Argentinian wine with nice acidity and alcohol, leaving savors similar to the aromas. Finish is beautiful, sweet, persistent and lovely. An 92-GB pts wonderful and unforgettable white wine!!

We didn't drink many Californians yet, but those we drank always had something more sweet than wished to our taste. This one is indeed labeled as Demi-sec. Good option to drink it with your friends who don't appreciate dry wines. Very fruity in the aromas and in the mouth, what we believe is a characteristic of the Californians. Medium body, purple color, well balanced in alcohol. We missed some acidity. Good to drink alone or pairing with a light pasta in tomatoes sauce. Cheers!

The nose is split between peppery tobacco notes and rich red fruit. The front palette is surprisingly juicy and jammy with blackberries; however, it quickly gives way to tobacco, leather, and a mild amount of oak. It finished with a clean and smooth tannic bite leaving me wanting more.

Not as full bodied as typical cramenere but complex and very well balanced. Lot of dark fruits on the nose. The body of sour cherries and blackberries. Very long and very sophisticated finish with blackberries, cassis, and some bitter notes. The taste is subtle and unlike most crameneres is better going alone. The spicy food would shadow the nuances.

Italian wine needs its time. Not like me, always in a hurry, always impatient. So is this young wine. I gave him half an hour, maybe an hour, I got good wine, with an impressive dark red color. But in the second half of the evening, a second taste reveals an impressive complex of aromas enveloping you in the aromas of the Piedmont hills, black and red fruits, spiced and ripe. Medium body, 13.5%, medium tannins and acidity and great finish, not long and slightly acidic. I Miss Pimonte..

A bouquet out of this world, full of fruit, tobacco and touch of acid. The first impression is round tannins then balanced sweet and smooth taste of berries, cask and light touch of tobacco followed by a lasting sense of all the above but softened by a light taste of licorice.

(4.4*) Port and Douro Wine Tasting São Paulo 2018. Superb wine. I like a lot this producer and this is its Icon Wine. Winemaker is Cristiano Van Zeller and the wine is a blend of traditional Douro's grapes aged for 24 months in french oak. Violet, dark red and purple color, with a very high concentration of mature dark red fruit aromas, black cherries and plums. On palate is an elegant wine with great balance and finesse and a very long and fruity finish.

100% Encruzado with 4 months in French oak. Fresh aromas of stewed apple with vanilla and light baking spice. An almost plastic note comes through (or candle wax) Fatty, unctuous palate with breadth. I’m not familiar with the grape, so can’t tell how much of the breadth is the grape vs the barrel. I’m assuming the wax /oiliness is the grape. Subtly rich palate. Full bodied with fresh acidity. I’d be interested to taste this after a bit of ageing. A great alternative to a lightly oaked Chardonnay.

Another fine example of Encruzado, a Dão variety that definitely deserves better recognition. This one is fermented & aged 6m in 6yo oak. Ribeiro Santo means ‘holy river’. Pale lemon. Very fresh & vibrant w. pineapple, apple, red apple, lemon peel & honeysuckle. Aromatic w. a touch of green herbs. Youthful. Dry. Ripe green apple, lemon, orange peel, zesty yet creamy. Delicious balance & concentration w. m+ flavour intensity. Slightly waxy & textural w. m+ alc, m+ body & a m+ finish. Very good.

Great nose, good palate, so so finish 🍷 Deep ruby slight garnet red with slight brown edge 👃 Stewed cherries, red/black berries in ash burnt oak oozing cooked chocolate with vanilla, slight minerals & earthy tones 👄 Medium sweet cherry palate with green tannic hints that distract from lovely onset of aromas & initial taste but oh boy that cocoa comes through in force 🎯 Med+ green vine & berry fruit finish showing slight dry tannins on end 👍 Great QPR sub £20 Pom

Second wine from the castle of Sales. Aromas of stewed fruits (cherries, blackcurrants, raspberries) with a hint of spices and cocoa. Velvety and ample mouth which confirms the nose. Melted tannins with one finale skilfully spiced on notes of cocoa. In short, a charming wine at his peak, that seduces me sips after sips...

Good intense fruit nose with long legs on the swirl. The palate has enough nuance and mint eucalyptus smoothness to make it a goodie. Maybe worth a buy on the 5 year keep... 4 on potential.

First time trying a Chardonnay from Chile. On the nose it's butter, creamed corn, and stewed apple with a bit of unripe pear. The palate is straight buttered popcorn and toast with spiced applesauce and noticable oak. Low to medium acid and medium-plus body with a long finish.

Best red wine in the new world at ExpoVinis Brasil 2015 and with 93 points at Wine Enthusiast, is made with 98% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc harvested in the 2014 harvest. Intense and deep ruby color shows floral and red fruit aromas, plum , coffee, mint, chocolate and fresh herbs, with passage for 12 months in French oak barrels, revealing a lot of power in the palate. With powerful, but round tannins, and long persistence is an excellent wine!

Happy PN Thursday Vivino friends! Had the 2013 of this over a year ago and it pleased me so I thought this vintage was worth a try! PN typicity this is as far as the cherry galore goes then allspice...not so typical, blackcurrant and red flowers. More red berries on the palate with an aniseed hint, again a floral perfume and a slight green feel with good not overpowering acidity as can be the case sometimes. Meh length.

Quite the accomplished chardonnay from the Spier folks. For those who enjoy a little of all things, this one's for you. Some fruit from the citrus end of the spectrum, as well as clear tropical fruit notes. A little pineapple reflected in the juicy acids. And then there's the creamy full-bodied feel, which goes ever so slightly towards banana. Mild oak. Swish finish. There you go, a bit of everything good that's chardonnay.

A mix of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Young wine; quite strong throughout and very prominent alcohol aftertaste. Dark pale ruby color; similar to a Pinot Noir. Needs to decant; becomes more tolerable. Acidity is a bit unbalanced. 12,5% ABV; very noticeable. Synthetic cork. Flavorful; hints of lemon, cinnamon, leather, and strawberry. Expected more because this wine is from Bodegas Escorihuela Gascón. It’s a cheap simple wine. Probably will be better in 2019. On sale for ARS$75; a bargain for a blend.

Translucent ruby, as expected from a Primitivo. Nose: besides raspberry, cherry candy notes. Palate: a little acid and after a while, a little sweet, medium bodied, intense tannins. Back smell of medicine (syroup). Well, I'm trying to explore Italian wines, but they are not my favorite style. Although this wine pairs well with pizza.

Amazing. A wine with true terroir and earth. Nose is leather and earth, just perfect. Flavor is complex, starting strong, and ending with a marked astringency. Barbera and Bonarda are not my favorite grapes, but this is definitely the best example I have tasted of this Northern Italian traditional combination.

Mendoza Merlot needs some light in the Dark Cava, whatever darkness it has, shine aint there. Dense rich dark purple. Aromas of violets and dark fruit. At start in mouth at top dryness, a dark fruit, spices and cedar hold. Toungue top of peppers tingle. Too fluid and young Merlot, too easy and medium bodied. Day by day, stays dark and sober.

Nova degustação do belo vinho branco uruguaio butique com 9 meses em barrica de carvalho francês novo. Aos olhos cor palha clara. Ao nariz frutas cítricas como casca de limão. A boca boa persistência e alto frescor. Recomento com extremo louvor. New tasting of the great Uruguayan white wine boutique with 9 months in new French oak barrels. Clear straw eyes to the eyes. To the nose citrus fruits like lemon peel. The mouth good persistence and high freshness. I recommend it with extreme praise. Cheers friend.

Barrel fermented Uruguay Chardonnay. 70% aged in new French oak for 8 months (the remainder inox). Complex butter and toast aromas with red apple and soft citrus lemon. Lovely texture , a mix between silky and grainy. Buttery from the mid palate. Medium bodied. Dry. M(+) acidity. Well structured. So far my favourite wine bar selection in São Paulo for non-natural wines.

Excellent value for money. Purple on the edges, this offers ripe red fruit next to gingerbread and oaky notes. Very round mouthfeel. A bit simple, and slightly short on the finish, but good balance and enjoyable overall. 3.5*.

We had this nice French last month in Kobe, although Bordeaux is famous for its red wine gives some fine whites too. This was a good one. Yellow color, aromas of fresh fruits as: citrus, lemon, and pineapple. High acidity. Medium body. Assorted perfectly our tuna dish that night.

In my quest to find another Bordeaux SB, I found this in a very unusual place. A quaint little kitchen shop in my town. Owner is Cordon Bleu trained and holds cooking classes in her shop. I paid $22 not the $11 shown here Distinct diesel on the nose. Some melon with lemongrass flavors with a spicy peppery finish. I loved it. I highly recommend

Eye: transparent ruby, some legs. Nose: very berry - with cherry, chokeberries and black currant, there is also vanilla, licorice and a hint of mint. Palate: mouthful and berry, with balanced tannins and citricity. Palate is with cherry taste and a bit sweetish. Long berry aftertaste. Not bad - 4.0/5.0

100% PN as far as I know from the village of Mercurey in the Cote Chalonnaise region of Burgundy. Decanted for a couple of hours to reveal a lovely wine. Fruity and slightly earthy notes on the nose, raspberry and cherry on the palate with earthy, vegetal, spicy notes on the finish. Excellently balanced, recommended by the wine merchant and I will buy it again.

Better than I guessed! Fruity. High acidity. Medium tannin feeling. Hint of cassis, and a little bit pepper-like spice. Medium body. Not so long but balanced finish. I know almost every Chilean wine is good value for money, and it seemed to be especially great value! It was like a good Oregon Pinot, I guessed. First attack was very nice. Good pairing with grilled pork with ginger.

4.3 This is a stunning blend of Malbec and Carignan. A wine that you can almost bite into it, with beautiful acidity, freshness and amazing fruit. Blueberries, unripe prunes, hints of purple flowers, leather, earthy and raspberries. Drinks like silk, has freshness and purity and still feels very young. Great work of Parra and Co.

Verybe expressive nose, most for ripe fruits. With a nice dark red-violet color, and a rather wide trim. From a blend of 2 grapes, being one of them one of my least favorite ones, Syrahs, though a very good surprise, with a complex palate and a good finishing acidity around the upper mouth, and an after finish for spices.

4.2 🌟 What a beauty! Worth trying for the nose alone. Violets, roses, cherries, and chocolate. Light and fresh on the palate, with a little black liquorice, plum, and mint. Soft, well rounded tannins and a long finish that took me back 25 years to my Gramma's kitchen and a cup of Black Currant tea. Enjoyed this with my tasting partner, my son, Devin. (the best wine drinking teenager around... 😂) He doesn't know how good he has it! $59 - Purchased at The Wine Cellar, Edmonton, Alberta. Good peeps! 😎

92 pts Blind I would have missed this as Rioja, with firmer structure and gravely slightly abrasive tannin it is deceptive but exceptionally good. This Colección Privada is never a typical Rioja in my experience which makes it an easy repeat. Superb depth and complexity of fruit, level after level pulling you into an immersive experience. The finish, estupendo!

Back to basics. Great modern rioja again. Excellent nose. Cedar, roasted toffee, dark berries, liguorice, leather and vanilla oak. Smooth acidity and silky tannins with blackberries on palate. Balanced and structured wine. Great long and spicy finish. Paired well with chicken pasta and sausages. Very near 4,5 stars but today its likely to be four. But at last minuts i was determinated that it shall be 4,5. Decanded two hours. Wife needs another rioja so lets pop an pour.

Dark cherry with a large amount of cloves, nutmeg and strong tannins right away. The aromas hit after the first taste but this helps soften the tannins a bit. The texture smooths out, mid-palate, but the spices stay pretty consistent through the finish. The only addition to the finish is a hint of acidity. Not a bad one at all.

Shows as a pale yellow with platinum undertones delivering the classic aromas of green vegetables dominated with asparagus. A very mineral and fresh palate so easy to get lost in the swirling flavors. Here again, Casa Marin delivers.

What a change from the '16! The asparagus notes are completely gone, replaced with huge tropical fruit flavours. Papaya and slightly buttered toasted coconut are dominant, that slip into a lemon rind crispness toward the end. Long, lingering aftertaste perfumes revisit the tropics, with some pineapple acidity. Just as great as last year, but a completely different Sauvignon Blanc.

This is a delicious wine and the difference here is that they put the wine to rest in used Jack Daniel’s barrels. It’s incredible but you can smell in the glass the notes of the whiskey very subtle in the back specially on the nose. In mouth is a round good wine.

High quality and low price, whats not to like. Deep dark red color, brilliant nose loaded with vanilla, smoke and oak. Taste is spicy with plenty of pepper. Hints from the time in whisky barrels is hinted but not overwhelming. Really an excellent feature. There are fruits, but they are just there as a good feature on top of everything else. Smooth afterglow, soft and silky. Closes everything in the best way.

MontGras... chilean producer with vineyards in Casablanca, Maulle, Leyda and other terroirs. This Reserva Pinot Noire is a very elegant red with great feshness due to excellent acidity and a deep minerality with great Ocean Pacific influence. I consider it almost as good as the elder brother Reserva Especial PN... and much cheaper!! Excellent!!

The Magasine USA Today once classified the Alentejo as the niggest and most beautifull wine state in the world! Seen from the Montsaraz heights, the imense planers of Reguengos and Perdigoes indeed are a magnificent view. Here bouth french like Alicante Bouschet and outoctone grapes achieve their maximum potencial giving birth to reds like Pera Manca. Tapada do Fidalgo is a tremendous value in range of USD$ 10.

Smoky blackcurrants dominate the nose, aged in French oak this Gran Reserva demonstrates well what is possible with young Cab-S. Complex, rounded and with more spice than Nando’s this example is smooth and rounded with a wonderfully opulent finish. Summary: Better than it seems at first this could be a Cab for non-Cab lovers - try this, you will like it!

A better-than-anticipated CdP, especially given the relatively low Vivino average score of 3.8. Shy on the nose, especially upon unveiling. On the palate, this is fairly bold, medium/ full-bodied and still fairly tannic, but I’d suggest this is drinking perfectly right now. Syrah led, or certainly this is the most apparent grape. A good level of depth and medium + finish mean this is a thoroughly enjoyable drop and probably just about right in terms of vfm @ £30 a go. Improving. 3.75-4 ⭐️ for me.

Eye: transparent ruby, some legs. Nose: very berry - with cherry, chokeberries and black currant, there is also vanilla, licorice and a hint of mint. Palate: mouthful and berry, with balanced tannins and citricity. Palate is with cherry taste and a bit sweetish. Long berry aftertaste. Not bad - 4.0/5.0

Big and beautiful. Mouth filling. Black berry. Black currant. Plum. Creaminess with supported tannins. The wine has a dark edge with a touch of smokey bushfire. Quite delicious. I probably could have given this 2011 more time but wtf. Life is short. Drink good wine

4.2 Enjoyed a taste of this coastal Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc at De Patio restaurant on Vitacura, Santiago Chile paired with beautiful seafood. Shows as a pale yellow with platinum undertones delivering the classic aromas of green vegetables dominated with asparagus. A very mineral and fresh palate so easy to get lost in the swirling flavors. Here again, Casa Marin delivers.

What a change from the '16! The asparagus notes are completely gone, replaced with huge tropical fruit flavours. Papaya and slightly buttered toasted coconut are dominant, that slip into a lemon rind crispness toward the end. Long, lingering aftertaste perfumes revisit the tropics, with some pineapple acidity. Just as great as last year, but a completely different Sauvignon Blanc.

One of the best Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon I've had! Focused black cherry and blackberry with a complex backdrop of sandalwood, nutmeg and dust. As it breathes, secondary layers of rich roasted coffee, leather, black olives, cinnamon and scents of black pepper. Complex structure and smooth texture create a balanced and elegant wine. It's dark and mystic, subtle and bold. If you can find a balanced dichotomy or a simple complexity that just makes sense for no other reason than it works, why not try it?

Orange Ruby colored, begins sweet and finish dry, tears are present, I noticed a very complex notes with vanilla, red berries (gooseberries a lot) and chocolate. Amazing drinkability and good valued in Brazil. I'm surprised with this wine and in my current opinion it is 5 stars without shadow of doubts.

Lighter body and sharp acidity that breathing doesn't make much difference on. Dark fruit, spices and a hint of cocoa runs through the palate. The cocoa is not as prominent as the 2010 or 2011 but this may need another year to sit. Decent length with sharp tannins and very subtle oak. Decent at this point but will likely try again in another year.

Incredibly vibrant violet purple. Arromas of licorice, intense violets, plums, and baked apple crisp with vanilla and cinnamon. On the palate it's light to medium bodied with a juicy mouthfeel, high acidity, and finely grained moderate tannin. There's flavors of plums, strawberries, cooked apple, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Then it finishes with plums, strawberries, cinnamon, and ethanol. This is a wonderful expression of these two varietals who were meant to be together, and it is a $20 slayer.

It’s a higher Cru (you can alao feel that its more acidic,even rhough its limeston-rich),the usage of some French barrels, the vintage itself didn’t gave the kind of structure the juice needed, despite the limestony soil.The wine not so round and complete, but of course its still young. We may see some nice aging,but in general the concentration of flavours and aromacompounds are lacking a bit.Some unpleasant VA is also noticeable.

Needs some time to breathe. My first castel del monte but I'm impressed. An incredibly clear scent of baked apple and strudel. The mouth confirms it, a bit less in style than the nose but still very well balanced with good length and exit. 3 bicchieri gambero rosso are earned for the unusual exotic character of this wine

3.7 quite sweet for a dry bottle of wine Plum, mint, and smoky, perfumed notes appear on the nose. The 2015 indicates a smooth palate with moderate acidity and low tannins and finishes with a sweet cherry mouthfeel.

Lighter body and sharp acidity that breathing doesn't make much difference on. Dark fruit, spices and a hint of cocoa runs through the palate. The cocoa is not as prominent as the 2010 or 2011 but this may need another year to sit. Decent length with sharp tannins and very subtle oak. Decent at this point but will likely try again in another year.

Incredibly vibrant violet purple. Arromas of licorice, intense violets, plums, and baked apple crisp with vanilla and cinnamon. On the palate it's light to medium bodied with a juicy mouthfeel, high acidity, and finely grained moderate tannin. There's flavors of plums, strawberries, cooked apple, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Then it finishes with plums, strawberries, cinnamon, and ethanol. This is a wonderful expression of these two varietals who were meant to be together, and it is a $20 slayer.

Good wine with good value for money. Easy to drink, but with little expression. Label in honor of the Sorboles, fruit trees that color the landscape of Campania. Made with 85% Aglianico and 15% Piedirosso. Without passing through wood. Aromas of cherry, strawberry, blackcurrant, herbs, spices and floral. on the palate medium body, good structure, high acidity. Tannic. Medium finish!!!

A better-than-anticipated CdP, especially given the relatively low Vivino average score of 3.8. Shy on the nose, especially upon unveiling. On the palate, this is fairly bold, medium/ full-bodied and still fairly tannic, but I’d suggest this is drinking perfectly right now. Syrah led, or certainly this is the most apparent grape. A good level of depth and medium + finish mean this is a thoroughly enjoyable drop and probably just about right in terms of vfm @ £30 a go. Improving. 3.75-4 ⭐️ for me.

Light yellow to green colour. Nose is subtle oak from the staves with citrus and tropical notes. Medium creamy body, balanced acidity cuts through the palate; lemon, grapefruit, melon, peach lead into a short finish. Not all that bad for a corporate big brand. The creaminess of the Chardonnay balanced by the aromatics of the Semillon.

Good entry shiraz. Tasty, good palate. Mouth and nose aligned. Touch of currant, chocolate vanilla, pepper, licorice, light wood like eucalyptus and oak. Black and red fruits stand out for plums and blackberries. 14% alcohol without disturbing. Well adjusted. Soft tannins and above-average acidity. Persistent medium long finish. Good to accompany a meat or lamb.

It is a great Italian wine. I like aromas a lot and this wine is very very aromatic and balanced. Orange Ruby colored, begins sweet and finish dry, tears are present, I noticed a very complex notes with vanilla, red berries (gooseberries a lot) and chocolate. Amazing drinkability and good valued in Brazil. I'm surprised with this wine and in my current opinion it is 5 stars without shadow of doubts.

One of the best Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon I've had! Focused black cherry and blackberry with a complex backdrop of sandalwood, nutmeg and dust. As it breathes, secondary layers of rich roasted coffee, leather, black olives, cinnamon and scents of black pepper. Complex structure and smooth texture create a balanced and elegant wine. It's dark and mystic, subtle and bold. If you can find a balanced dichotomy or a simple complexity that just makes sense for no other reason than it works, why not try it?

100% Viognier. Young 🍷. Great quality. Easy drinking. 13,9% ABV; high for a white wine but unnoticeable. Must be chilled. Synthetic cork; expected natural cork. Medium gold color. Balanced acidity. Creamy texture. 90% of the 🍷 was aged in stainless steel for 15 days and 10% in French oak for 6 months. Flavors; notes of pear, ginger, mineral and herbs. Aromas; hints of grapefruit, citrus, rosemary and oak. Bought for ARS$190; great CxB for a hard to find varietal. Greatly paired with Hawaiian salmon poke.

Bright light golden colour with a green hue. Pure and intense nose of barely ripe stone fruit, citrus, fresh butter, fine oak and crushed nuts. The palate is bright and fresh, medium weight with a lively acidity underlined by a creamy/buttery texture with elegant fruit, zesty citrus notes and a long warm finish. Nicely restrained and salivating style.

This Toscana blend is quite typical, Sangiovese plus some Canaiolo, always present in Chiantis. This one, much softer than Chiantis, though. Aroma of raspberries, clove and dark chocolate. Mild tannins, medium body and acidity, easy to drink and to pair. Good wine. $ 25 in Brazil, probably half that elsewhere.

Rather nice, a excellent Italian dark red table 🍷. No need to try to impress you with all the descriptions, fruity, plum, deep ruby, and all that feces. (Hmmm the icon disappeared.)

I had a feeling that this wine will be very good and I was right. Dark ruby color. Intense nose with plums, cherries and oak. Palate is full, round with great balance between fruit, acidity and tannins. The power of this wine comes from all these elements being in good proportions. Stunner at this price range!

Mencia, similar to cab franc. Light refreshing red. A deep 'vivino red' hue. Cherries, leather and balsalmic herbs on the nose. Silky cherries followed by a tart drying oak. Med tannins and acidity. First juicy, then tart. Good structure and finesse. Amazing pqr, $7!!! = +1/2 star. Will be buying a lot of this. A nice lighter everyday red. Great with tacos, pizza, or empanadas

Interesting how a top Rosso is much more of an experience than a low-level Brunello. And this is a top Rosso! The nose is subtle with red fruits and a hint of the spices that are yet to come. In the mouth it's a pleasure with some pleasant sweet notes tickling the tip of your tongue, preparing you for a balanced mix of tarty acidity, fresh red fruits, pepper and dry tannines.

Dark clouded ruby fading on the rim. Decanted the sediment. Greeted with a bouquet of sauteed mushrooms, leather, braised roast, and earth. Dry attack, medium to heavy body, grippy tannins and acidic structure. Hot, slightly bitter finish takes away from mouthfeel. Gamey palate, but very little fruit on nose or palate, would have liked some but at this age it may be gone. Drink now as the window on this seems to be closing. This would go great with cheese and charcuterie or even a gooey french onion soup.

We didn't drink many Californians yet, but those we drank always had something more sweet than wished to our taste. This one is indeed labeled as Demi-sec. Good option to drink it with your friends who don't appreciate dry wines. Very fruity in the aromas and in the mouth, what we believe is a characteristic of the Californians. Medium body, purple color, well balanced in alcohol. We missed some acidity. Good to drink alone or pairing with a light pasta in tomatoes sauce. Cheers!

Happy PN Thursday Vivino friends! Had the 2013 of this over a year ago and it pleased me so I thought this vintage was worth a try! PN typicity this is as far as the cherry galore goes then allspice...not so typical, blackcurrant and red flowers. More red berries on the palate with an aniseed hint, again a floral perfume and a slight green feel with good not overpowering acidity as can be the case sometimes. Meh length.

Dark cherry with a large amount of cloves, nutmeg and strong tannins right away. The aromas hit after the first taste but this helps soften the tannins a bit. The texture smooths out, mid-palate, but the spices stay pretty consistent through the finish. The only addition to the finish is a hint of acidity. Not a bad one at all.

It’s a higher Cru (you can alao feel that its more acidic,even rhough its limeston-rich),the usage of some French barrels, the vintage itself didn’t gave the kind of structure the juice needed, despite the limestony soil.The wine not so round and complete, but of course its still young. We may see some nice aging,but in general the concentration of flavours and aromacompounds are lacking a bit.Some unpleasant VA is also noticeable.

Bright ruby color at the approach with a nice red fruit nose that lead near to floral. A faint and quickly fading spice note. On the palate it is well balanced but subtle. Light and refreshing, but nothing steaming to make an impact. Very Soft tannin and a medium to short finish that is pleasant and balanced. Never going to blow you away, but a very nice daily drinker.

Interesting Malbec blend from South Argentina ( rio negre). Floral / red fruit (strawberry) start. Quite aromatic. Medium body ( floats on the palate) with nice acidity. Chalky/mineral notes throughout with very intense spiced plum/black cherry. Animal / meat subtleties. Tannins are velvety. Finish has some distance. Strikes a perfect chord between elegance and power, yet focused palate pleasing flavours. Solid 4+

Quite enjoyable Malbec/Merlot blend! I can’t say I’ve ever had a blend of only these two grapes, but it definitely worked here! Deep ruby with pronounced aroma of strawberry jam, tobacco, spice. Medium plus bodied, chalky tannins, long finish. Strawberry jam really jumps on the tongue along with dark fruits and well composed tobacco/oak notes. This is a smooth, juicy, lovable Patagonian Bordeaux blend!

Very interesting wine. It brings not only a mix of black fruits at nose, like cassis and dry plums, but in the end (and as it breaths more, it gets more pronounced) an explosion of spices... I’d say some black pepper and some violet too... it has also some vanilla and coffee nuances. Quite a character, with good tannins

Lovely deep ruby colour, now 4 years old. Still showing plenty of red fruit aromas with lively spicy notes. Damsons and plummy flavours dominate the palate and, although quite dry, the tannins and oak gives the wine a certain roundness that, coupled with the fresh spicy notes, leads to a balanced and well made wine with a nice fruity finish. Good value Douro wine

It’s amazing how this winery keeps producing +92 rated wines. This is no exception. Of a ruby red with violet reflections, this wine displays an intense aroma with notes of cassis, ripe black currants and sweet spices. Untoasted oak barrels provide subtle, well-integrated notes that allow it to express its personality in all its potential.

I’m not a huge fan of Chardonnays but this one is quite nice. Nice oak and citrus on the nose. In the beginning there is nice lemon lime taste that marks well the beginning and leads to the woodsy mid range and end. Nice wine to drink in the summer.

My vote for top wine of the Italian evening. It's a big fat bottomed fruity number. A Sicilian one that immediately says refined and I am told it is one of the few to get DOCG status locally. It is a blend 50:50 of two grape that I can't pronounce. Lighter in body but high tannins. Too fine for Pizza at $55. I do very much like this one. I say top taste of the night.

Happy PN Thursday Vivino friends! Had the 2013 of this over a year ago and it pleased me so I thought this vintage was worth a try! PN typicity this is as far as the cherry galore goes then allspice...not so typical, blackcurrant and red flowers. More red berries on the palate with an aniseed hint, again a floral perfume and a slight green feel with good not overpowering acidity as can be the case sometimes. Meh length.

It’s a higher Cru (you can alao feel that its more acidic,even rhough its limeston-rich),the usage of some French barrels, the vintage itself didn’t gave the kind of structure the juice needed, despite the limestony soil.The wine not so round and complete, but of course its still young. We may see some nice aging,but in general the concentration of flavours and aromacompounds are lacking a bit.Some unpleasant VA is also noticeable.

Mendocino varietal wine made of Chardonnay grapes that were aged for 12 months in oak barrels. Clear and brilliant straw yellow color with golden reflexes. Very intense and elegant white and yellow fruit aromas with notes of butter, vanilla, minerals and honey. Medium-bodied (13.9%) Argentinian wine with nice acidity and alcohol, leaving savors similar to the aromas. Finish is beautiful, sweet, persistent and lovely. An 92-GB pts wonderful and unforgettable white wine!!

Light yellow to green colour. Nose is subtle oak from the staves with citrus and tropical notes. Medium creamy body, balanced acidity cuts through the palate; lemon, grapefruit, melon, peach lead into a short finish. Not all that bad for a corporate big brand. The creaminess of the Chardonnay balanced by the aromatics of the Semillon.

Bursting with aromas of cherries, raspberries, vanilla spice, and smoke, I loved this budget friendly wine from Sicily. Peppery notes combined with more smoke, earth, licorice, and rich red fruit were balanced with medium tannins and good friendly acidity. Enjoy with vegetable lasagna, toasted or grilled meats, or a rabbit stew!

Bright light golden colour. Pure, fresh and youthful nose, no noticeable oak, fresh fruit like crushed apple, pear and citrus. Medium bodied palate, pure and crisp fruit, well balanced in a pure unoaked style with plenty of lively acidity, juicy fruit and a long warm but fresh finish.

Nice fruity smell, with a taste of peach and a perfect amount of acid, balanced to the fruity side and a superb affordable alternative to a summer rose on a hot day. Close to 4,5 stars, but misses an edge to be differentiated enough for that.

I can't say we'll rebuy often, bc it's not in our price range. We were celebrating something, and this was recommended by a trusted source and I'd happily rebuy under those circumstances! Awesome beside a steak, and I truly felt there were more layers than the typical wine I'd have picked.

At first it was almost an insignificant nose. It got better once it breathed more. Has strong hints of blackberry and plum. What I like is that it is nice and dry. Unfortunately the finish is a bit acidic, but I think it's because it needs to breath more. Definitely a wine you need to open a long while before you drink.

Que Guapo has a lovely bottle that evokes Caminito in Buenos Aires. It's made of: Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), and Bonarda. It has a brilliant violaceous red colour and well-defined aromas of blackberry/black pepper. It has a young/juicy mouthfeel and flavours of blackberry/black pepper with a vegetable whiff. It has medium acidity and velvet tannins. There's a jammy aftertaste with medium persistence. In general, an easy drinking Malbec-driven option that catches tradition, hence paired with Choripan.

Had it at a wedding in Ibiza. Pretty good blend. It's mostly Tempranillo and only a little bit of CS, can't remember how much exactly. Very drinkable, smooth, light in a perfect way to be crowd pleaser.

Shows an intense purple red with violet shades. Fruity, fresh and intense , with hints of baked raspberry and blackberry jam as well as a balsamic touch . Spicy note due to its time in oak barrels. In the mouth with persistently fruit , quite balanced and meaty with long aftertaste.

Ruby-red color in the glas! On the nose spectrum of fruit compote, spices and tobacco, shows complex aroma structure and much finesse! On the palate dominant nuances of black cherry, black plum and black pepper with a strong body, finely developed tannins and a long finish! Cheers!

Dark ruby red & clear, almost black. The rich aromas are of dark plum, cedar, ripe black mulberries, some pepper & turps. The palate shows some plum, blackberry, pepper, & tarry notes with good length.

Bright dark purple colour with a lighter rim. The nose combines an herbal spiciness with ripe dark fruit, plum, cassis and red currant. Nice palate, rather medium bodied with dense fruit, ripe tannin, a savoury and ripe herbal spiciness but no green flavours, sage and mint, finely grained tannin, some cocoa notes, integrated wood and a long finish.

Most emblematic winery of modern winemaking in Uruguay and its premium wines with an intense personality and a deep sense of belonging to the land. With the advice of the international winemaker Alberto Antonini, they apply their philosophy that revolves around the elaboration of wines that become the expression of their origin in Maldonado. Many awards include Best Uruguayan Producer! The excellent mineral Pinot Grigio has grabbed many medals and 88 pts by WE.

100% pure, classic Cab. You'll find everything here what supposed to be in a outstanding Cab: leather, plum, blackberry, tabbaco, spice, juicy and velvety tannins and live acidty. But wait, there is more. Black chocolate and raisins on smell. Black currant, coffee beans on taste. Powerful, long finish with black chocolate, spice and black tea. Full bodied with perfect balance wine. Thick, succulent and addictive liquid. This is something between Napa and Bordeaux. Like state of Chile 🤠🍷🍷😄

2015 CS from Chile, Maipo Valley, 14 m aged in French oak barrels. Beautiful in nose, lots of berries with black currants in front, oak, hint of vanilla. Even better on the palate. Very nicely balanced, full body, medium pleasantly spiny tannins, finely integrated acidity. And long aftertaste with hints of coffee beans, mushrooms, black chocolate. Could be aged and definitely will become more expressive. Loved this CS. Would search for other vintages. 4.3

Soft aromas. Vibrant red fruit with plums, pomegranate and very ripe figs with fleeting undertones of exotic spices and a sharp bite of cocoa powder. It’s pretty light bodied and keeps a smooth texture throughout the finish. Speaking of the finish, again, smooth spices, light oak and the remnants of the smooth texture. I wish I could go higher on the rating but most of the flavors are short-lived. The saving grace was the silky texture. For that, I’ll go the extra half star.

This bright, fresh Sancerre is a subtle wine that is particularly notable because it has other things going on besides grassy notes. The wine is a light straw yellow. The nose and mouth are full of lemon drop candies and minerality with only the slightest hint of fresh cut grass. It’s light bodied with balanced acidity. I wish I had paired it with a salad and goat cheese.

Another perfect example from Miguel Torres. Lots of dark fruit and a big after taste which lingers on. Hardly no tannins. In short, what a wine.

Dry. Impressive nose, smooth taste, even for relatively young Cabernet Sauvignon. I got it at a very good price, hence the good final score.

All the characteristics of a good Sauvignon. Not swamped with oak, strong black current flavors, great bouquet, long aftertaste! We got this as part of an Enoteca bargain pack (¥1080 rather than the average ¥1,950!

Significantly weaker than the 2015 vintage. Less oak fruit and acidity so all out of balance .... And less alcohol so maybe a harder yes for ripeness? a pity. The 2015 was an affordable crowd pleaser for the over oaked Chardonnay swillers here.

Great Albariño wine. After church we came to this fish restaurant where I opened this great spanish albariño. Limpid light yellow color. Sophisticated nose starting with wet grass, passing through peachs and white roses to end up in subtile herbs. In mouth good acidity, fresh and refreshing, pleasant bitter citric and herbal flavors with lingering finish, leaving a wonderfull bitter citric aftertaste. Went perfectly with our whiting grilled fish! Recomended. Cheers!!!

We have great time and plenty of wines here in Pauillac and areas! This white CdP, owned by JC Cazes, Lynch-Bages iwas new to us, so let's try! A medium deep yellow, nose full of yellow fruits, minerals and some light yeasts and wood. On the palate fantastic round and full, ripe yellow fruits and gooseberry, citrus nuances, minerals, hay, light oak. Lingering long! Perfect for a glass or along food!

Made with organically cultivated grapes, this opens with aromas that recall scorched earth, creme de cassis, leather, toasted bread, dried herbs and a whiff of barnyard. The dense and full concentrated palate delivers mature black currant, dark plum, mocha and a confectionary note alongside round and smooth tannins. This ends up in a long lasting and truly satisfying finish!!

The tannins were luscious and well integrated, with bright acidity and a long finish. Drinking well now, but will be peaking for the next 3 years. Good value for a developed wine.

Well well well. What do we have here? Such a quixotic little Malbec. You are a naughty one, aren’t you? Tobacco and vanilla aromas. Quite pleasant. Smooth. Round. Your tannins are surprisingly well balanced considering some other Malbecs I’ve known. Medium finish. I met you in Buenos Aires.

Dark purple core with a lighter rim. Fragrant nose with floral hints, rose petal, cassis, dark berries and aromatic herbs with discreet oak. The palate is still youthful and dense but with ripe tannin, delicious dark fruit and good length, just still needing some time to open and gain nuance.

This Malbec is supposed to be the entry level for the Del Fin Del Mundo guys and it blows many other “higher level” Malbecs out of the water with ease. Lots of oak, ripe red fruit, pepper and a hint of dark chocolate. Persistent and full-bodied. Very good!

Thanks Robin for arranging this Chili Vallee Colchagua single vineyard Malbec a novelty for me. Pleasant surpise at 11 EUR pricetag. Does have a sturdy tannin structure which I expect from this noble varietal. Handpicked to reach maximum ripeness.

My coup de coeur in this marathon tasting. Petit Verdot in purezza, 2015, the sun and the breeze of the Tuscan coast. This is pure joy to drink, deeply colored rightly concentrated, dry but so fruity, freshly crushed red and black berries, spices and a touch of well managed oak. ❤️

Wow! It's my first contact with Italian Petit Verdot and I'm very impressed - especially keeping in mind that 100% Sangiovese slop from the same cantina I had an hour ago. Very dry, very complex and very particular - only lightest hints of common fruits on the nose, the very best part is occupied by strongest spicy aromas: white pepper, basilico, herbs, currant leaves and some wood. Full and very bold body - lot of minerals, tobacco, leather and forest green berries on the palate, medium-high acidity...TBC

The San Martino dares Cabernet Sauvignon together with Petit Verdot and the result is remarkable and convincing with a balsamic Mediterranean touch rich in spiced blackberry fruit and mineral scents. Scented and ripe wine with notes of roasted espresso and butterscotch. Balanced with broad, ripe dark raspberry fruit flavors and a decent oak integration.

The top end of the Mazzei range this is always a 50/50 Sangiovese and Merlot blend only from the best parcels of the estate. The nose is almost pronounced with aromas of blackberry, blueberries and black cherries with a spiced plum finish. Plenty of forest floor, vanilla and toast that’s well integrated. Acidity, tannins and alcohol are high and well balanced. This wine is still young and I think we have just opened it’s drinking potential, with easily another 20 or so years to go!

Medium magenta colour. On the nose blackberries, black currants, eucalyptus, liquorice and vanilla. On the palate full bodied with chewy tannins, intense fruit on the mid palate. Acidity is high and it finishes with plums and tobacco. This is almost there and needs at least a bit over a year to be ready.

Third wine from my hang with my old professor friend. This was an audible, a game time decision to crack a 3rd & enjoy with some tapas as the conversation was flowing along with the wine I knew he loves 🇵🇹 wines so cracked this & served blind. He guessed 🇪🇸 or 🇵🇹 right away, then honed in on 🇵🇹. I told him he should join Vivino already 🤣 So earthy & herbaceous in all the right ways. A perfect match to tapas & fresh basil 🌿 & tomato 🍅 from my garden Loads of rich black fruit, toasted oak >>

Of course we need to try the Riserva as well. Ruby red with maturing brick rims. Still very young on the nose with dried cherries, volatility, plums, tobacco, oak (from 50hl bottis - but new). Great acidity with taste of sour cherries and cranberries, oaky and chewy tannins. Still some work to get all components together. But great potential I think - without knowing this producer and haven’t tried older vintages. Great finish with a bite.

90 Points - A well made Nero di Troia from Puglia in Southern Italy. 30% Montepulciano. Surprisingly elegant for such a warm climate, with dried roses, tobacco, leather, cedar, dark cherry and plum. The tannins were luscious and well integrated, with bright acidity and a long finish. Drinking well now, but will be peaking for the next 3 years. Good value for a developed wine.

Pink purple deep red. Like the bottle wrap. Distict high and big nose jumping at you, out of the glass. From the “supertuscan” area so at this price, its a find by somebody, thx. Tastes, shows and smells like alcohol. At 14.5 % we would like that less. The other fragrances are less prominent, so alcohol is what you get. Bordeaux grape blend with not enough farm in it. Pity, but the area is groeing out of its jacket. “Factory” try at selling this by numbers. 5 Euros more would have been very well spent.

I think this can benefit from another 5+yrs cellaring, possibly a 4.5-5 star with time, the tannin structure suggest it can soften up with time. This took a while to come out, but after showing notes of tabacco and spices as classic Syrah, after 4-5 hours it changed showing beautiful of scents of roses, very special and after a few minutes something changed, mentolo or actually the nose became like the “after eight” mint chocolate, insane! But it only laster a few minutes.. the magic of wine!

Made with organically cultivated grapes, this opens with aromas that recall scorched earth, creme de cassis, leather, toasted bread, dried herbs and a whiff of barnyard. The dense and full concentrated palate delivers mature black currant, dark plum, mocha and a confectionary note alongside round and smooth tannins. This ends up in a long lasting and truly satisfying finish!!

Blackberry, black cherry and smoke on the nose. Full-bodied, with soft, ripe tannins and a long aftertaste of chocolate, coffee, and ripe fruit. Beautiful and opulent.

High acidity, medium body, with firm tannin. Almost reminded of a lighter Nebbiolo with it's red fruit and spice. Anise, pepper, and raspberry. This could benefit from another 3-4 years in cellar.

A very solid red Etna, with 80% Nerello Mascalese. 👃🏼 Delicate red and black berries: mostly blackberry. Slightly floral and spicy with violet and liquorice. 👅 Already some body, not as light as some 100% NM from Etna, I’ve tried before. Some dusty smokiness, bay leaf, just a hint of nutmeg. Soft tannins and good fresh minty and eucalyptus acidity. 📍 Had at home. Got from EST distributor- Wine&Sun.

My coup de coeur in this marathon tasting. Petit Verdot in purezza, 2015, the sun and the breeze of the Tuscan coast. This is pure joy to drink, deeply colored rightly concentrated, dry but so fruity, freshly crushed red and black berries, spices and a touch of well managed oak. ❤️

Wow! It's my first contact with Italian Petit Verdot and I'm very impressed - especially keeping in mind that 100% Sangiovese slop from the same cantina I had an hour ago. Very dry, very complex and very particular - only lightest hints of common fruits on the nose, the very best part is occupied by strongest spicy aromas: white pepper, basilico, herbs, currant leaves and some wood. Full and very bold body - lot of minerals, tobacco, leather and forest green berries on the palate, medium-high acidity...TBC

The San Martino dares Cabernet Sauvignon together with Petit Verdot and the result is remarkable and convincing with a balsamic Mediterranean touch rich in spiced blackberry fruit and mineral scents. Scented and ripe wine with notes of roasted espresso and butterscotch. Balanced with broad, ripe dark raspberry fruit flavors and a decent oak integration.

93 pts 4.4 Tasted at the winery young but with great potential. Stefano is a first generation winemaker which simply defies belief given the exceptional quality of his wines. Another winemaker who gained from Quintarelli and his Amarone in most certainly in the top 5 for the region. He produces wine for himself, to be drank by people with similar taste and not to be put away for that illusive special occasion. A generous and passionate host and a visit I will remember.

4.1 - This excellent Chianti is proof that the style has evolved past it's old shitty-wine-in-a-funny-bottle image. This is delicate, reserved, and yet displays the refinement and complexity that Sangiovese is capable of from good producers. Soft, tart red cherries, accents of oak, stewed tomato skins, and integration of baking spices and tobacco made for a complex, soft-spoken Chianti that still retains it's varietal markers.

I'm suspicious to talk about this wine once Argentinean's Malbec is one of my favorite style! The color is an intense dark ruby, with purple and violet reflections. At nose, very fruity, with remarkable ripe fresh plum and blackberry, but at the same time, a complexity of nutmag, wet wood, peppers and some vanilla. In the mouth, intense blackpepper and chocolate, a wine that perfectly fill in the mouth, with a nice round and persistent tannins, full bodied, very well balanced and a delicious long end! Good!

Dark ruby, violet reflection. Scents are amazing: blackberry, plum, nutmeg, black pepper, eucalyptus and oak. On the palate, it is totally balanced in acidity and alcohol. Tannins are very remarkable, but velvet at the same time. Full bodied. It goes very well with mature cheese. Fantastic Malbec! I really love this style!

An intense aroma of funky grape skin (2 days skin maceration according to ExoticWineTravel’s notes). Peach and pear undertones. Complex and interesting. Medium (+) acidity and intense flavours. On the mid palate it approaches spiced (cloves) poached apples /pear.

Vinitaly - Here is a lovely biodynamic Grillo from vines located near the sea (vignamare means vines on the sea). No added sulfites and maceration during at least 24h. After some breath (first nose is inelegant) the result is a complex nose (ripe orange and citrus). Palate is salty and fresh with the right depth and acidity. Not an easy wine but for some, a lovely one. 15,5/20.

Interesting 100% Agiorgitiko from Nemea, Greece. As I understand Agiorgitiko comes from “St. georg” which actually is the old name of the city of Nemea (?) - a blue grape variety also present in many rosés. Ruby color. Nice summer flowers, cherries, chocolate and brambles on the nose. High intensity and medium body. Super integrated tannins. Velvet feeling, with a nice dry ending. Semi bitterness after. Some etanol notes. Fantastic first encounter with this grape. Try! 1,8gr/l sugar, 4,8gr/l acidity

Happy Sangiovese Sunday morning! We had this on Friday night but have been ignoring Vivino until now. Doh! 4.2. A very nice Chianti Classico! Deep fruit flavours on the nose with a touch of herbal presence. Less acidity than one would expect yet still quite dry. Tart berries of raspberry and cranberry. Some spice on the finale. Had alone late in the evening and it paired nicely with itself. :)

Aromas of cherry, blackberry, tobacco, earth, oak, mint, licorice and spices. On the palate good body, structured, well balanced, good acidity. Polished tannins. Ends with good persistence.

Pink purple deep red. Like the bottle wrap. Distict high and big nose jumping at you, out of the glass. From the “supertuscan” area so at this price, its a find by somebody, thx. Tastes, shows and smells like alcohol. At 14.5 % we would like that less. The other fragrances are less prominent, so alcohol is what you get. Bordeaux grape blend with not enough farm in it. Pity, but the area is groeing out of its jacket. “Factory” try at selling this by numbers. 5 Euros more would have been very well spent.

My 2nd Faro from Sicily and i will keep looking for more. After about 1 hour, the initial focused heated black pepper aroma integrates well, but maintains its presence, with the emerging (and after a while) very intense aromas of deep cherries, flowers and some oak. On the 2nd day, showing similar profile but with some fresh rosemary in the mix. Will drink well for the next 2-3 years.

One of the least eventful noses I have encountered in a while. There is almost nothing here to smell save for a single warm alcohol note that is not entirely unpleasant but doesn't get you excited. The palate is where it shines. Fruit forward and immediately bracing. Lots of lush fruit. Tapers to a warming spicy centre and then finished tight and clean with a nice palate cleaning astringency and some very fine tannins. Worth a try. Easy to enjoy.

4.3. Wine #5 from the Calgary /Montana Vivino meet up, and the first red. This was my first contribution. I thought I'd fool everyone by not bringing a Brunello, but when the guessing began it started with Italy. Doh! Anyway, this is a Super Tuscan blend with mostly Syrah, there's Petit Verdot in support. Cherry, blueberry, leather, earth and tobacco notes. Good balance. Cheers!

Again, very Tiefenbrunner = sophisticated wine: 1/3 tank, 1/3big oak, 1/3barrique... . Good structure, weight and lenght, complex a bit oily, but with freshness and just right ammount of oak. Fantastic, seriouse, enjoyable wine considering the price. 👍

Fantastic, deep and rich red blend, Touriga Nacional, Alfrocheiro and Tinta Roriz. The Alfrocheiro imparts concentrated inky colour and flavour of rich earthy forest floor. Nose of perfumed flowers, wild berries, eucalyptus, pine needles, tobacco leaves. Palate offers spices, chocolate, graphite, good structure, fine tannins, balanced with vibrant acidity, finish is long with minerals and spice. Mid altitude and surrounding forest terroir adds character and complexity. 4.2

From Mauritius / This white port bottle was actually a gift we made to Shyamal's mum. She was really curious to taste white port, and it was a success (who wouldn't like white port anyway!)... Gorgeous amber colour, with a nose full of aromas. Wood, oak, vanilla, spices... Overwhelming! The palate presents delicious caramel and dry fruits (sultanas) flavours. A real bounty to be served chilled.

2010 must have been better, but has finished... ( This one is classic good Etna rosso DOC with no wow. Much laquer in the aroma alongside with every DFB with cherry dominant. Palate is full, complex, structured, ripe, spicy&chocy. Balance is good with high acidity, obvious tannins&med body. Rather elegant inspite of some facts above. )

Interesting 100% Agiorgitiko from Nemea, Greece. As I understand Agiorgitiko comes from “St. georg” which actually is the old name of the city of Nemea (?) - a blue grape variety also present in many rosés. Ruby color. Nice summer flowers, cherries, chocolate and brambles on the nose. High intensity and medium body. Super integrated tannins. Velvet feeling, with a nice dry ending. Semi bitterness after. Some etanol notes. Fantastic first encounter with this grape. Try! 1,8gr/l sugar, 4,8gr/l acidity

Small family run company in the hills of Grosseto who produce following organic-byodinamic rules. Mainly Trebbiano toscano grape with some space for Vermentino and Malvasia bianca. I met this wine at Viniveri and I fell in love. It's such an intense porfume, a vivid colour and a plain taste, rounded, complete, apricot, peach, flowers bouquet. It's worthed.

Giallo oro carico, quasi da vendemmia tardiva. Il naso si apre con calma e ci dice che la maturità c'è tutta. Un'albicocca avvolta in un guanto roccioso, poi viene fuori la macchia, i suoi profumi intensi delle erbe di Maremma. L'attacco non dà scampo a papille non avvezze: è secco, completamente secco, altero ed elegante, con struttura superiore corroborata da un accenno tannico, finché emerge una certa presuntuosa nobiltà, giusto prima di riaprire sul frutto mineralizzato della prima olfazione. Complesso.

Questo biologico di uve autoctone senza aggiunta di lieviti selezionati ha bisogno di un po di tempo per esprimersi e sicuramente non è un vino a largo consenso anche per via delle uve. Asciutto ma comunque morbido e con un ottimo equilibrio è andato progressivamente nel corso della serata in un positivo crescendo.

Even better than the Teroldego - silky, übersmooth yet complex nose. Heavy on thyme, fennel, blackberries and the like. Very good. Also beats the cab sauv in my book. Will have to double check that!

The Islay of red wines? Smokey chimney aromas which, after a good firm swirling release blackberry notes. Light bodied with medium tannins. A long complex finish which takes you through fruit to smoke to a mellowness. Pairs well with salami. Not so well with smoked salmon.

Lifted black cherry aromas. Very ripe cherry flavours upfront, backed by hints of black coffee and pepper. Decent balance, fine acid and a little palate cleansing tannin make this a nice wine.

His reflection changes into the waters of the changing mirror, into the crystal that changes like the fire. The colour of this wine is purple with deep intensity. Scent reveals red fruit, cherry and coffee aromas with medium intensity. In mouth perfectly round and smooth with cherry flavours. It is dry wine with medium acidity and medium tannins. Wine has full body and medium finish. It is very good wine. I imagine big t-bone steak with this wine. Tribute to Tomislav Tuden who recommended me this wine.

The new vintage of Albe has just recently been released in Sweden and what a great vintage it is. Still young and a bit restrained but there is greatness luring that surely will evolve in the coming years. It needs to breath for a couple of hour if to be enjoyed already now. The balance and structure is excellent and the tannins gives the wine a foundation that promises many years of evolvement. There’s also a nice complexity and a medium finish that gets longer after a couple of hours.

Deep ruby colour with pinkish hue. Quite an alcoholic nose which has some florals elements. For me the palate is better than the nose. Tannins are almost the first bit I get. Then sweetish, artificial cherries. Reasonable levels of sugar. Something peppery to finish with. Thought it was a nice galaxy to drink. Not as heavy as others from the region.

Opening the Christmas festivities with the family. We start with this good Chardonnay from Zuccardi. The nose brings a lot of pineapple, some peaches, honey, vanilla and moist rock.

Surely the best Pecorino I have ever had: very complex, with stone fruits and yellow flowers on the nose, together with hints of vanilla. It is even better on the palate, displaying a great structure with looong finish. Incredible wine

Perfect white wine from La Marche, central Italy. I was really impressed by this wine. Aromas of flowers. Full of flavors and rich of taste. Dark yellow of color. Medium in acidity. Taste of ripe melon and honey.

New vintage, this time tried back in Europe. Still not their absolutely best wine, but good, after a bit of breathing: blackcurrant, dark chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of leather on the finish

A gorgeous and tantalizing plume of baked plum and Smokey chocolate start this story. Rich layers of texture with an exuberant elegance on the palate. Black cherries, tobacco, caramel and bursts of blackberry come forth. The tannins are super approachable and the finish trails into a winding meadow packed full of brambles and fresh tobacco. What a divine wine!

My 2nd Faro from Sicily and i will keep looking for more. After about 1 hour, the initial focused heated black pepper aroma integrates well, but maintains its presence, with the emerging (and after a while) very intense aromas of deep cherries, flowers and some oak. On the 2nd day, showing similar profile but with some fresh rosemary in the mix. Will drink well for the next 2-3 years.

Well well well. What do we have here? Such a quixotic little Malbec. You are a naughty one, aren’t you? Tobacco and vanilla aromas. Quite pleasant. Smooth. Round. Your tannins are surprisingly well balanced considering some other Malbecs I’ve known. Medium finish. I met you in Buenos Aires. NB: Rutini Wines was the first winery to plant in the Uco Valley in Mendoza. (My philosophy? If it says “Uco”, buy it.)

Even better than the Teroldego - silky, übersmooth yet complex nose. Heavy on thyme, fennel, blackberries and the like. Very good. Also beats the cab sauv in my book. Will have to double check that!

Deep crystal ruby with dark red rims, no legs, no tears at 15.5% ABV. Strong nose is dried red and black berries, strong eucalyptus, earthy notes of forrest after rain, interesting spices hail with the regular mix like turmeric, linden. Full body, med+ acid, large silky tannins. Dry palate is still elegant with full nose flavors turn to taste here with resins and balsamic souce. Finish is med+ strength but unending with full flavors. I smoked a Cohiba siglo VI cigar with it and fellas that's life!! 😜🎶

The Islay of red wines? Smokey chimney aromas which, after a good firm swirling release blackberry notes. Light bodied with medium tannins. A long complex finish which takes you through fruit to smoke to a mellowness. Pairs well with salami. Not so well with smoked salmon.

Lifted black cherry aromas. Very ripe cherry flavours upfront, backed by hints of black coffee and pepper. Decent balance, fine acid and a little palate cleansing tannin make this a nice wine.

I can't say we'll rebuy often, bc it's not in our price range. We were celebrating something, and this was recommended by a trusted source and I'd happily rebuy under those circumstances! Awesome beside a steak, and I truly felt there were more layers than the typical wine I'd have picked.

Ink black meets the eye, Opens up with a scent of leather, tobacco dense cellar, and after some time a balanced blue flowery nose with violet, anis, liquorice and slight tone of blueberrry vanilla. Still a youthful complex fruit with medium + acidity makes this a lengthy finish that most certainly works just great in 10 years.

Que Guapo has a lovely bottle that evokes Caminito in Buenos Aires. It's made of: Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), and Bonarda. It has a brilliant violaceous red colour and well-defined aromas of blackberry/black pepper. It has a young/juicy mouthfeel and flavours of blackberry/black pepper with a vegetable whiff. It has medium acidity and velvet tannins. There's a jammy aftertaste with medium persistence. In general, an easy drinking Malbec-driven option that catches tradition, hence paired with Choripan.

This one impressed for the good. There is the typical acidity of a white (at the end), as the beginning is quite buttery or silky. I could even smell passion fruit on this one (rare for me mention something so specific). Quite a great cost benefit as well. Partially aged on New French oak also puts the great aroma. 4 stars is based on the cost benefit as well. I really enjoyed this one.

4.2 One of the 3 winners of the evening for me at Chile Wine Fest 2018. The event is held over a two days period at Parque Bicentenario in Vitacura at a walking distance from the apartment.  This pinot noir shows with a nice medium limpid ruby red color. The aromas were those of red berries, strawberry, cherries, ,mixed with spices and some mushrooms. The mouth is rich with the red fruits sharing the space with the low tannins and the persistent acidity.

A really classic gooseberry Sauvignon Blanc. Lots of the stylish balanced fruit and acidity that I have come to expect as a given from Casa Marín, but still impressive. The fruit tail melds into a smooth minerals and lemon juice freshness, but still holding that gooseberry fruit close.

Visit to the Vineyard 2 4.5. Simply stunning. If you haven’t tried it yet but get the chance, grab it with both hands and don’t let go of the bottle! 85% was aged in stainless steel and the remaining 15% in used French oak. Nose of lime, chalk and minerals, green pepper and green chili pepper with freshly cut grass. On the palate, green pepper again and maracuya. Sharp steely acidity wrapped up in lush citrus fruit.

Very clean crisp fruity aroma without exaggeration. Palate, well balanced ripe fruit character with medium + acidity. Very good example of Chablis, good value for money.

This 8 USD pinot noir is extremely pleasant. 1st vintage was 2009 from a young vineyard planted on its own roots 20 km away from the ocean on granite soil at Casablanca. There is greatness to come for this vineyard. Aged in nuetral oak and stainless to preserve the fruit. Nose is of dark raspberry with good intense dark cherries and sweet spice. Showcasing the purity and ripeness of its fruit. Easy palate with high acidity and a touch of residual sugar on medium minus finish 87 pts. Died in 1.5h

100% Torrontés. Good wine. 13,5% ABV; a bit pronounced at the end but tolerable. Dry. Acidity is a bit above average. Medium straw color. Twist off cap. Produced by Finca Eugenio Bustos. Aged in stainless steel tanks. From Valle de Famatina in the La Rioja region; 600Km north of Mendoza. Great body and medium finish. Flavors of lime, pear, minerals and pineapple. Aromas of orange peel, green apple and perfume. Bought it on sale for R$19,90 at WineBr; great CxB! Paired with salmon poke at Nemo - Fortaleza.

A very nice wine. Fresh fruits from the nose to first tasted. Plum, wild cherries, and hints of strawberries. There are oak and smoke in the mid range that makes it very pleasant. It’s a very smooth wine that would go well with about anything except a strong meat dish. It lacks the body to stand up to a steak.

Happy WWW friends 🥂 Vivino says it has five grape varieties and the label three...Encruzado, Bical and Malvasia Fina, so who do we believe 🤔 Anyway it's a lovely juice I think. I don't drink much Portuguese wine but this has encouraged me 😄 Rightly charismatic as the label states...lime and lemon curd cream tarts, zesty with a touch of rind, pear, peach, a hint of melon and perfumed white flowers. Crisp, lemony with a touch of tartness on the palate enveloped in a tad of creamy goodness and acidity.

This wine has improved quite substantially since last tasted 6 months ago. Ripe cherries, red fruit and subtle barrique notes. Nice play between sweetness and acidity. Quite a full bodied Pinot but still very elegant. Now in a nice drinking window with plenty of life ahead. 94/100

A top wine in Rioja by a top winemaker. And although it is at the €55 range, it is certainly a good value for money wine. Elegancy with flavour. Pure equilibrium. Balance. Harmony. Wood is there but extremely polished. 'Black attitude' but with extreme agility. Opening with ripe black and red forest fruits. Plums. Touch of vanilla without getting to lactic. Refinement. Frank.

The nose is a mix of smoke, leather, and sweet dark fruit. On the front palate, though black cherry is dominant, giving it a jammy quality. The oak is subtle, the mouthfeel is very rich, and the acidity is a little high lending it a freshness. The finish is moderate and fruity with only the gentlest tannic presence. The wine is not terribly complex, but it has a fruit forward drinkability that is appealing.

Delicious. Refreshing. Lively. Having it as a desert, but well deserve a creamy cheese. Honest wine that feels like a drink made from grapes, not a furniture...hehe

Bright purple with a nose of black cherries and white pepper. This young wine is drinking beautifully, on the palate it’s big black cherries, hint of liquorice; tart finish. Big fruity number.

Very nice contemporary Napa cab. The nose is brambles, leather and a hint of creosote but promises a little more than it ultimately delivers. To paraphrase an 80's classic ""your nose is writing checks that your body can't cash!"". The body has plenty of dark fruit, mesquite and leather but is slightly overpowered by the earthy tannins. That said, the finish comes to the rescue and cashes that check with a seemingly everlasting bonus. Bone dry, fruit and allspice. Going ballistic in AZ!

Solid cab, on the lighter side and less complex compared to other cab's from the Cali region. One of the better choices with spicy food... which leads to my higher rating in the category.

Date night! This Uruguayan Tannat is a 50-50 blend from two vineyards: one with sandy soil + a continental climate & the other with clay soils + a maritime climate. Sweet florals on the nose (candied violet) meet savory notes (inkwell, cacao, berry, smoke). Grippy tannins on the palate. Sour cherry, blackberry, hint of cola, mulling spices, and a surprisingly light amount of oak for the 18 months this was aged. Medium plus body, feisty acidity. Great foil for smoky grilled octopus & parrillada mixa!

Margarita Ysern married Jaime Carrau in 1680. Near 1700 they founded this J. Carrau winery. This gran reserva is made with 50% Tannat from continental vineyards and 50% from near ocean places. Then 18 months in barrel and some more time in bottle. And that's a great wine. Delicious aroma of figs, plums and blackberries. In mouth, soft tanins, medium acidity and long cassis end. A great Tannat, as was the 2012 I already tasted.

I promisse to taste it again and on the next time I will add some useful notes, at least tanin, acidy, body, smelt and aspect, so other users can use it as a basis for their decision and comparison.

I am drinking a boutique Turkish Malbec (TN coming after this one!) And wanted to use this wine as a reference! Crystal ruby with pink rims, slow long legs and tears at 14% ABV. Strong nose is very herbal with pepper, mint, corriander and a little annoying recently burnt gunpowder. Cherry and chive follow. Full body, med+ acidity, large chewable strong tannins. Dry palate is licorice, black tea and maraschino liquor with nose spices turn to taste. Finish is strong long and full. Decent nice Arg. malbec

2/2 We probably opened this too soon by several years, no matter for our anniversary it was worth every sip. 👃 Nose: Rich ripe plum, chocolate & aromas of marzipan (like that on a wedding cake 😋😉) with cherry cigar hints. 👅 Palate: Ripe cherry & dark chocolate with a surprisingly spicy Wicks bubble gum character. 🏁 Finish: Smooth velvety tannins & a spectacular peppery spicy clove like lingering finish. 🍴 Pairing: A delectable pairing to a rump steak, green beans & a butternut & sweet potato bake.

On the palate, full bodied, spicy, remarkable and fine tannins, long end, pretty well balanced. Back smell of cherry. A perfect wine for special occasions!

From Chile’s soil master, Pedro Parra, comes this field blend consisting of Mourvèdre, Cinsault, Syrah, Carignan, Malbec and Carmenere. Old vines (60 to 110 years old) and aged in cement and steel for 1 year. The wine showcases the varietals very nicely and I do get a sense of place when drinking this. Succulent black, blue and red fruits, dirt and smoke all come together seamlessly to produce a near term, fruit forward red that’s sure to become a crowd pleaser. I’ll be looking out for more of this.

As simple as simple gets. Black plum , light smoke and spices with blackberry undertones. A little oak but only a touch. Long finish with the oak touches and blackberry that goes on and on... the finish helped with the extra star... it literally went on for several minutes.

Great wine tasted at. Descorchados 2018 in Barra da Tijuca. Good value for money. Made with 100% Carignan of old vines and organic farming. Without stage in oak. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, licorice, menthol, spices and floral. In the mouth full bodied, structured, good complexity and acidity. Soft tannins. Ends with good persistence!.

The nose is split between peppery tobacco notes and rich red fruit. The front palette is surprisingly juicy and jammy with blackberries; however, it quickly gives way to tobacco, leather, and a mild amount of oak. It finished with a clean and smooth tannic bite leaving me wanting more.

A nice blend of Grenache and Syrah from the Midi in the south of France. Ruby red color, tempting nose of red berries, red current, Mediterranean spices, fresh mint and licorice, medium body with firm rough tannins that need a bit of time to mellow, quite rigid acidity and a long dry finish. Mid pallet was a bit hollow and it definitely needs a bit more time. My score 85, drink 2017-2024

A mix of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot. Young wine; quite strong throughout and very prominent alcohol aftertaste. Dark pale ruby color; similar to a Pinot Noir. Needs to decant; becomes more tolerable. Acidity is a bit unbalanced. 12,5% ABV; very noticeable. Synthetic cork. Flavorful; hints of lemon, cinnamon, leather, and strawberry. Expected more because this wine is from Bodegas Escorihuela Gascón. It’s a cheap simple wine. Probably will be better in 2019. On sale for ARS$75; a bargain for a blend.

Translucent ruby, as expected from a Primitivo. Nose: besides raspberry, cherry candy notes. Palate: a little acid and after a while, a little sweet, medium bodied, intense tannins. Back smell of medicine (syroup). Well, I'm trying to explore Italian wines, but they are not my favorite style. Although this wine pairs well with pizza.

Great wine from Ernesto Catena that personally selects the fruit and puts a lot of love in your choices. Made with 100% Malbec biodynamic vineyard. Aged for 14-16 months in French and American oak barrels . Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, cassis, chocolate, smoke, pepper, cinnamon, vanilla and floral. On the palate good body, structured, well balanced, good complexity and acidity. Silky tannins. Long and persistent finish!

Amazing. A wine with true terroir and earth. Nose is leather and earth, just perfect. Flavor is complex, starting strong, and ending with a marked astringency. Barbera and Bonarda are not my favorite grapes, but this is definitely the best example I have tasted of this Northern Italian traditional combination.

Significantly weaker than the 2015 vintage. Less oak fruit and acidity so all out of balance .... And less alcohol so maybe a harder yes for ripeness? a pity. The 2015 was an affordable crowd pleaser for the over oaked Chardonnay swillers here.

Nariz não é o forte desse vinho mas é uma boa surpresa na boca. Encorpado, persistente e bem agradável. It's a good surprise on the palate but not in the nose. Full body and a long final.

Very smooth and pleasant south brazil wine! Bought directly at the winery. I would give a 3,7 but roll up a 4. Not perfumed, teroldego is a tough to dominate grape. Dark and dense full body, velvet with some rock shades. Mouth is fruit, dark berries, light plum tick and a chocolate & caramel finish.

4,5⭐️ Visited Bodega Contador this morning. La Cueva del Contador 2015. Nose of cherry tart, blackberries, rips, english licorice and hint of menthol. On the palate elegant, black berries, red pebber and young spicy chili pebbers. Cedar tree and discrete vanilla oak. Perfectly balanced wine with medium body, medium acidity and medium plus alcohol with spicy and burning and long pleasant aftertaste. Rioja at its best!

A top wine in Rioja by a top winemaker. And although it is at the €55 range, it is certainly a good value for money wine. Elegancy with flavour. Pure equilibrium. Balance. Harmony. Wood is there but extremely polished. 'Black attitude' but with extreme agility. Opening with ripe black and red forest fruits. Plums. Touch of vanilla without getting to lactic. Refinement. Frank.

Already improving. Last rating 3.5*. 2013 starting to hit a really nice stride. Still needs aeration... this was ‘pull n pour’ and then some serous whirlpool action in the glass. I’m thinking >550 RPM! This was my ‘spinning class’ tonight! Suddenly, opens and show nice complexity and depth! Unleashing great memories from the visit at La Massa itself. Yup, it’s a good 4.0* now. But remember that swirl if you open now! [Rocky T, can your motorised aerator handle this??] Paired w. med. rare tenderloin 💪

Attenzione! One hour aeration IS THE MUST!!! Suppose it can happen so that you'll find this red undrinkably rough and sharp straight after uncorking but it starts opening after 15' and reaches the OK-level within next 45 minutes. After that: beautiful nose of ripe cherries, plums, some cocoa and vaniglia, medium-full body: more black fruits, some spicy wood and tobacco on the palate, high acidity, nicely done tannins - I really liked them! - not bad (though not too long) spicy finish. VFM is average

Very nice contemporary Napa cab. The nose is brambles, leather and a hint of creosote but promises a little more than it ultimately delivers. To paraphrase an 80's classic ""your nose is writing checks that your body can't cash!"". The body has plenty of dark fruit, mesquite and leather but is slightly overpowered by the earthy tannins. That said, the finish comes to the rescue and cashes that check with a seemingly everlasting bonus. Bone dry, fruit and allspice. Going ballistic in AZ!

Still in Aracaju we went to this great restaurant where we had a terrific gastronomic experience with chef Seychelles reviewing local cuisine. To pair with a dried meat dish I opened this outstanding brazilian wine, considered one of the best. Dense dark red color. Nose of dark fruits, followed by vanila and coccoa to end in subtile tobacco. In mouth powerfull body but rounded up tannins, ellegant flavors, and remarkable presence and lasting. Simple, effective and unforgettable. Cheers!

A savory richness of toasted herbs and fresh olives hits my nose before notes of dried cherries and pomegranate mingle with strong mineral scents like slate stone and granite. Spicy on the palate with bracing acidity leading to a long finish with cedar notes and a tart, sanguine edge that needs food to find softness. Complex, with hints of bitterness from the volcanic minerality that dominate the aftertaste, though there is plentiful fruit acidity to fill the palate, a very distinctive and special wine!

A little unbalanced and bitter on the ending. A good food wine with a tangy ending. Much softer after an hour of airtime. 100% Aglianico grapes are hand picked. Aged for 12 months in oak barrels. I paired it with a charcuterie board of meats and cheeses. 14% alcohol by volume. 84 points.

First Chilean Syrah and it's pretty awesome. Rich red and black fruit with nice rich chocolate and oak flavours. Well balanced. Alcohol is high but not burning. Really nice.

Dark fruit, peppery with a light rosemary on the finish. Underlying thick, dark rose 🥀 floral aromas. Some tertiary appearing. Drinkable surprisingly quickly after opening. Better after 30-45 minutes airing.

Dark fruit aromas, pronounced flavours of ripe blackberries and plums with powerful tannins. Long juicy finish with mineral notes. Maker says it's ready, but I'd have liked it to have a couple more years in cellar which would moderate the tannins and make for a more harmonious wine.

One of the best Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon I've had! Focused black cherry and blackberry with a complex backdrop of sandalwood, nutmeg and dust. As it breathes, secondary layers of rich roasted coffee, leather, black olives, cinnamon and scents of black pepper. Complex structure and smooth texture create a balanced and elegant wine. It's dark and mystic, subtle and bold. If you can find a balanced dichotomy or a simple complexity that just makes sense for no other reason than it works, why not try it?

It is a great Italian wine. I like aromas a lot and this wine is very very aromatic and balanced. Orange Ruby colored, begins sweet and finish dry, tears are present, I noticed a very complex notes with vanilla, red berries (gooseberries a lot) and chocolate. Amazing drinkability and good valued in Brazil. I'm surprised with this wine and in my current opinion it is 5 stars without shadow of doubts.

Good wine with good value for money. Easy to drink, but with little expression. Label in honor of the Sorboles, fruit trees that color the landscape of Campania. Made with 85% Aglianico and 15% Piedirosso. Without passing through wood. Aromas of cherry, strawberry, blackcurrant, herbs, spices and floral. on the palate medium body, good structure, high acidity. Tannic. Medium finish!!!

100% Viognier. Young 🍷. Great quality. Easy drinking. 13,9% ABV; high for a white wine but unnoticeable. Must be chilled. Synthetic cork; expected natural cork. Medium gold color. Balanced acidity. Creamy texture. 90% of the 🍷 was aged in stainless steel for 15 days and 10% in French oak for 6 months. Flavors; notes of pear, ginger, mineral and herbs. Aromas; hints of grapefruit, citrus, rosemary and oak. Bought for ARS$190; great CxB for a hard to find varietal. Greatly paired with Hawaiian salmon poke.

Southern Portugal white blend of arinto, Anton vaz and a few other friends. Perfect symmetry of mouthfeel , acidity and freshness. Mandarin orange / lemons / tangerine? Nose was very muted. Palate made up for it. Finish okay. Solid I would buy again 3.75. Really starting to enjoy both arinto and Anton vaz as grape varietals.

Seen from the Montsaraz heights, the imense planers of Reguengos and Perdigoes indeed are a magnificent view. Here bouth french like Alicante Bouschet and outoctone grapes achieve their maximum potencial giving birth to reds like Pera Manca. Tapada do Fidalgo is a tremendous value in range of USD$ 10.

Great Albariño wine. After church we came to this fish restaurant where I opened this great spanish albariño. Limpid light yellow color. Sophisticated nose starting with wet grass, passing through peachs and white roses to end up in subtile herbs. In mouth good acidity, fresh and refreshing, pleasant bitter citric and herbal flavors with lingering finish, leaving a wonderfull bitter citric aftertaste. Went perfectly with our whiting grilled fish! Recomended. Cheers!!!

High quality and low price, whats not to like. Deep dark red color, brilliant nose loaded with vanilla, smoke and oak. Taste is spicy with plenty of pepper. Hints from the time in whisky barrels is hinted but not overwhelming. Really an excellent feature. There are fruits, but they are just there as a good feature on top of everything else. Smooth afterglow, soft and silky. Closes everything in the best way.

Great wine tasted in the Confraternity of the Deselegants on the Argentine Wine Event. Made with 100% Malbec from Tupungato and with small production. Aged in oak barrels. Aromas of blackberry, cherry, plum, chocolate, licorice, gentle oak, spices, vanilla and floral. On the palate good body, structured, powerful, good complexity and acidity. Soft tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Great Malbec. Deep purple color, opaque, clean, and brilliant. The nose reminds me dark chocolate, coffee, blackhead and cinnamon. The palate is intense and powerful, mellow, tender warmful, good acidity and tannins very present. Aftertaste a bit herbal and very persistent. A must. In its apogeu I guess.

Better than I guessed! Fruity. High acidity. Medium tannin feeling. Hint of cassis, and a little bit pepper-like spice. Medium body. Not so long but balanced finish. I know almost every Chilean wine is good value for money, and it seemed to be especially great value! It was like a good Oregon Pinot, I guessed. First attack was very nice. Good pairing with grilled pork with ginger.

Blueberries, unripe prunes, hints of purple flowers, leather, earthy and raspberries. Drinks like silk, has freshness and purity and still feels very young. Great work of Parra and Co.

4.2 Enjoyed a taste of this coastal Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc at De Patio restaurant on Vitacura, Santiago Chile paired with beautiful seafood. Shows as a pale yellow with platinum undertones delivering the classic aromas of green vegetables dominated with asparagus. A very mineral and fresh palate so easy to get lost in the swirling flavors. Here again, Casa Marin delivers.

Papaya and slightly buttered toasted coconut are dominant, that slip into a lemon rind crispness toward the end. Long, lingering aftertaste perfumes revisit the tropics, with some pineapple acidity. Just as great as last year, but a completely different Sauvignon Blanc.

Lighter body and sharp acidity that breathing doesn't make much difference on. Dark fruit, spices and a hint of cocoa runs through the palate. The cocoa is not as prominent as the 2010 or 2011 but this may need another year to sit. Decent length with sharp tannins and very subtle oak. Decent at this point but will likely try again in another year.

Incredibly vibrant violet purple. Arromas of licorice, intense violets, plums, and baked apple crisp with vanilla and cinnamon. On the palate it's light to medium bodied with a juicy mouthfeel, high acidity, and finely grained moderate tannin. There's flavors of plums, strawberries, cooked apple, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Then it finishes with plums, strawberries, cinnamon, and ethanol. This is a wonderful expression of these two varietals who were meant to be together, and it is a $20 slayer.

Get a bottle or three NOW. This is deep and rich in color, nose and palate. Blackberries, black cherries, saddle leather, and tobacco backed by chewy but nicely integrated tannins. Needs time in cellar or a 3-hour decant. Calls for beef or a nice cigar. Cheers.

Located in the Toro region of Spain with 4 vineyards located along the south bank of the Duero River. The wine named after a legendary Spanish city that was destroyed (after 20 yrs of resistance) by Roman legions. A powerhouse of aromas and flavors, dark fruit, spice and earthy scents. On the palate blackberry and currant flavors with cacao, pepper & oak, well balanced. Fine tight tannins that opened nicely after 45 minutes, lingering, complex ending with fruit, spice & mineral character.

Greenish yellow, very floral and complex, with citrus, yellow fruits (mango / peach) fruits and well integrated oak notes. Fresh and soft, with balanced acidity providing a very pleasant long finish. Clearly prepared to age well if you resist waiting!

Many layers in this glass! Strong fruit: roasted cherry and plum with hints of orange, cork, cedar, anise, lemongrass, and cardamom. Deepens with food, though that also brings up as you dive down. Strawberry notes join the cherry in the glass, as does the suggestion of vanilla.

Violet ruby. Delicated in all aspects. Scents of blackberry and blueberry jam, eucalyptus, leather, spices, vanilla, a bit of flower. In the mouth, it's medium bodied, almost no tannins, but with persistent tannin, spicy. Back smell of raspberry. Pretty nice wine!!!

Inky deep garnet hue like an octopus just left my glass. Nose of wet gravel and plum that opens with a red pepper, raspberry sauce then a dry middle that transitions into long tangy finish of herbs, sweet tobacco and red plum. Paired with prime top sirloin, baked potato and almond green beans. This big red represents the primal basics...no soft complex notes here, just a big red kick of Cab Franc!

3.9 Big blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec to start the week on Monday. Brunello on Tuesday!!! 😋😋😀😀 Nice lustrous almandine garnet red color with intense purple undertones. Good distinctive aromas of cranberry, eucalyptus, tobacco and licorice. The palate offered strong tannins but short while the acidity nicely developed a mouthwatering ambiance for the fruits to convey their flavors. With time it developed raspberry flavors.

4.3 Beautiful, deep, bright violet red color with ruby hues. Very aromatic and fresh. Reminds of raspberries, cherries and pomegranates accompanied by violet notes. It unwinds elegantly revealing soft spicy notes such as white pepper, strawberries, blueberries, bitter chocolate and a soft truffle note that stands out. A wine with silky tannins, great persistence, finesse and elegance.

Still very young. Rich, dark, tannic, concentrated, with good acidity and huge potential. The wine is robust and complex, no polish, no compromises, 95 Parker, and I understand why. The style of the house is a bit old fashioned, naive in terms of business, very straightforward and true to terroir. Great value. 4.2

Was taken by surprise by the first notes of vanilla and wood, reminded me of Drew Estate Juicy Lucy cigars in my humidor. Tanins are notably present at first taste but so smooth that they diminish over time, dark berries, candy winegums, wood and vanilla blends nicely to make a flavorfull wine.

Good wine tasting at the Alentejo Wine Event at the Sheraton Hotel in Rio de Janeiro. It’s name originates from the title given to members of the 15th century Priest Congregation of St. John the Evangelist. Loios monks have always had a deep connection to the history of Alentejo. Made with Arinto, Rabo de Ovelha and Roupeiro. Aromas of lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit and mineral. On the palate medium body, good structure, well balanced, good acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence➡️➡️

Lime and grapefruit on the nose. Mid weight with any citrus flavour very much in the background as the acidity dominates. A wine to drink during a meal. On reflection I've increased my rating to 4 stars as it's a subtle and well crafted wine.

A nice, dark and robust Douro red. 12 months in oak and that shows! Right away lots of sweet oak on the nose. It quites down in the glass becoming more spicy, savoury, smoky. On the palate at first that oak continues. Strong chocolatw and coffee, with air more dark fruit and licorice spice, earthy notes. Firm, full-bodied, good but round harmonious tannins. Went well with a warming stew now that autumn is starting to present itself up here.

Good to be drinking Alentejo again. Stewed strawberries on the nose. Notes red cherry, lavender and small hints of chocolate and caramel. High acidity, simple tannins but bring balance. A bit too much alcohol for this to get a higher ranking but fruit and provides depth for the palate. 3.9

So elegant and burgundian. On the palate it is just so lovely, elegant, charming pure sweet red fruit. Refined, with silky texture, just weightless, sexy and charming.

Happy Nebbiolo/ Piemonte Monday. With my constant diet of fish / seafood on vacation went with a white Piemonte. Arneis “aka little rascal” as it’s tough to grow. From Roero ( best region) From the great Vietti. 50th harvest of this wine So history on this wines side 😉 Enjoyable white; floral start ; yummy green apple 🍏 / unripe pear with a citrus zing. Sweet almond finish Wine has some nice weight on the palate. Quenching acidity. 3.9 rounded up cause drinking it in the sun ☀️. Yum

90 Points - A delicious Arneis from a classic Piemonte producer. Very floral aromatics, with cheerful Lemon, green and red apple, and heaps of daisies, lilac and honeysuckle. The body is full, almost waxy, and if I tasted this blind I might have guessed Marsanne. No oak to speak of, just brilliant fruits, flowers and beeswax.

Located in the Toro region of Spain with 4 vineyards located along the south bank of the Duero River. The wine named after a legendary Spanish city that was destroyed (after 20 yrs of resistance) by Roman legions. A powerhouse of aromas and flavors, dark fruit, spice and earthy scents. On the palate blackberry and currant flavors with cacao, pepper & oak, well balanced. Fine tight tannins that opened nicely after 45 minutes, lingering, complex ending with fruit, spice & mineral character.

Candied cherry, clove, orange peel, strawberry jam and red licorice are conveyed on the nose. Dry, medium acidity and tannin, medium plus alcohol. Black licorice, mushroom, cranberry and chocolate emerge simultaneously on the palate. A well-made wine that's refined while being a more ripe style of Pinot Noir.

3.8 Mesmerizing 😂 . Refreshing juicy white, and my first Gavi! Thanks KK, I used your review to snag this. 100% Cortese from 30yo vines planted at 300m in clay & mark soil. Aged six months in stainless. Juicy fresh mouthfeel thanks to the bright acidity that carries through the finish. Mineral focus with chalk & flint, leading to pear, apple, grapefruit, and hints of spice. I assume some lees time as I pick up some yeast notes as well. Perfect way to end the warm weather!

Always a real treat! Heavy, oily, meaty and full on smokiness! Nose of overly ripe blackberries, touch of blueberry, oak and tobacco. Eastern spices on the tongue, with a mix of pepper, vanilla, chocolate and licorice. Absolutely lovely balance with clear tannins that are in check and some super acidity.

Vega Sicilia-tasting❗️wine#3 You often hear that grapes should be pressed as soon as possible after harvest. However after these grapes were harvested, they were left in a cold place for 12 hours in order to preserve their fruitiness. Looks: very dense/dark almost black with purple edge. Scent: Roasted coffee beans, black berries and morello cherries. Mouthfeel: much better balance in this one compared to the last two, but it could also be a matter of age. Chocolate and liquorice on the pallet. Affordable!

If you like to drive corvettes, smoke Cohiba cigars, or step into the ring without gloves, this deep inky gem is for you. You know you're playing with fire from the instant that the crimson flows - Carmenere isn't usually this dark, perhaps courtesy of the Petit Verdot sprinkled in with Malbec. The wet cement on the nose is reinforced with layers of chewy tobacco leaves and toasty oak. Glad we decanted. Block out a couple of hours on the calendar for this one, Wolves of Wall Street style.

Dark red color. Delicious velvety one with nice red berries nose. Smooth tannins. I had already rated this but today it’s better: my 🇸🇪 in law made a delicious pasta and everyone was happy 😃. I agree easily with 3.7 on that. With my family and in laws in Costa Rica 🇨🇷. Coloração escura. Saboroso e aveludado com aroma de bagas vermelhas. Taninos macios. Já tinha avaliado mas hoje foi melhor: meu concunhado 🇸🇪 fez uma bela massa bolonhesa que deixou toda a família feliz. Daria tranquilamente 3,7

Not bad at all! Good wine Beautiful ruby red color. The nose is complex, showing fruits like blackberries and raspberries, with hints of vanilla and tobacco. An expressive palate is potent yet fresh, touched with chocolate and mocha, and a good concentration of ripe tannins. Well balanced, with a long, pleasant finish. Solid 4 stars Cheers friend enjoy the weekend

My first Syrah from Chile & it’s a winner. Beautiful dark fruit & spice with a touch of oak. Give this one an hour or two to open up & you’ll be rewarded.

( 3,8 ). Very good wine tasted in ViniBraExpo 2018, First place among 19 registered labels. Made with 100 % Pinot Noir from Campos de Cima da Serra. Aged for 12 months in new French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, blackberry, raspberry, cassis, spices, vanilla, herbs and floral. On the palate medium body, structured, well balanced, good acidity. Fine tannins. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!

Brazilian Merlot blind tasting - 3rd place! But not far from the 2nd! We choose 3 Merlot from Serra Gaucha to have fun in a blinding taste at home and we had a lot of fun! 8-) Two of them costing around BRL 35 and one BRL 90. The result was very interesting! Not possible to describe everything we learned in only 512 characters. This bottle is a great cost benefit! Half star more for that! Fruity, medium bodied, sweet aftertaste and well balanced! A good surprise! My brother and Jacque placed it on 2nd.

Pronounced aromas of black cherry, blueberry, raspberry, green bell pepper, rosemary. - Dry - Medium (+) acidity - Medium fine grained tannins - High alcohol - Medium body - Medium (+) flavour intensity Decent array of fruit and herbal/herbaceous aromas and flavours at a pretty good intensity level. Tannin and alcohol is well integrated and in balance with the flavour resulting in an elegant structure. Bell pepper aromas starts to dominate over the fruit after some breathing. Length is modest. Drink now.

Very good wine. Load of black currant on smell and taste. Also gentle tabbaco, earth and red cherry aromas. Taste is smooth with low acidity (I wish it was more), smooth tannins, velvety texture. Very unique taste, besides black currant. I have problem to describe it. Ash? Something bitter- sweet. Tart? Some kind of medicine syrop? Three and a half 🌟 plus a half for incredible QPR. Less then $12 in Costco.

Decanted 3 hours. Cherry liqueur, blackberry, and cassis on the nose. Dark, earthy profile with a medium+ body — blackberry, currant, cherry, plum, leather. Medium length finish where the earthiness comes through. Only 13% abv but the finish has fair acidity that can sometimes overtake the earthy tannins. A reasonably-priced Medoc that offers decent value, but probably won’t blow you away. We paired it with Julia’s homemade white pizza with garlic oil, but it was equally pleasant on its own. 3.31.18

I was searching for something in my wine fridge to match the vol au vent with mashed potatoes, and this one did it. Nice minerality, some creaminess.

Textbook Chablis on the nose with mineral chalky notes. Great citrus acidity and length signalling this is a solid quality wine. At $45 it's pretty reasonable for a Chablis (at least in the BC market). This will appeal to Chablis purists. And while I like my Chards oaky I can imagine it would pair smashingly with seafood.

4- straight out of the bottle! Great wine at great price bought after a suggestion of vivino. I don't have much experience with Malbec so the closest I can refer to is a Sangiovese-Negroamaro blend, if such a thing even exists. Nose was very inviting plentiful of plum red fruit blackberry & similar notes. Body was thick, rich, rewarding, with light velvety tannins & a balanced acidity, ending with few bitter, mineral, violet shades. Alcohol was intense but not disturbing; mild secondary aromas. Long finish!

Another great Douro blend. Crimson colour, nose of leather, black currant, dried violets, rich deep spices, undertones of oak. The palate is mildly dry, and offers lifted acidity, with raspberry, red cherry, vanilla, framed by creamy chocolate and dried plum, harmoniously woven smooth tannins, persistent finish. Clearly French and American oak barrel aging, adding great structure and texture. 4.1

Was looking for Cab Franc in the cellar but had none, this stood in with a similar profile and delivered, it’s herbaceous, balance of red fruit and black fruit, juicy up front, strong tannins. It’s a low end 4 star, can’t give it 3.5, it has some nice complexity but falls short on the finish. Good value wine for under $20 but there’s better options.

Post-holiday in Portugal this summer, picked this up on a whim in local off-licence in London. From the less-well-known north of the country, this Dão wine impressed. A combination of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. Red fruit but reminded most of a rich tomato and olive sauce, quite meaty but some herbal back notes too. Good body and a bit more to come on the palate in terms of leather and spice from the 12-months in oak. Long finish. Best paired with food, stew or similar.

Happy WWW friends 🥂 Vivino says it has five grape varieties and the label three...Encruzado, Bical and Malvasia Fina, so who do we believe 🤔 Anyway it's a lovely juice I think. I don't drink much Portuguese wine but this has encouraged me 😄 Rightly charismatic as the label states...lime and lemon curd cream tarts, zesty with a touch of rind, pear, peach, a hint of melon and perfumed white flowers. Crisp, lemony with a touch of tartness on the palate enveloped in a tad of creamy goodness and acidity.

This wine has improved quite substantially since last tasted 6 months ago. Ripe cherries, red fruit and subtle barrique notes. Nice play between sweetness and acidity. Quite a full bodied Pinot but still very elegant. Now in a nice drinking window with plenty of life ahead. 94/100

Torrontes is a very confusing grape. There are more than five different varieties of the grape that are grown in Spain, Argentina, Portugal that are referred to as Torrontes. These are Torrontes, Torrontes de Montilla, Torrontes Mendocino, Torrontes Riojano and Torrontes Sanjuanino. In addition, certain varieties have been matched genetically to the grapes known as Malvasia (most likely ‘Fina’), Moscatel Amarillo, Hebén AKA Gibi in North Africa, Criolla, Albillo Mayor, Alarije and Fernao Pires.>>>

2,9 for this Chilean white. Looks: Pale yellow. Scent: Medium minus intensity. Pear, chalk, vanilla and a hint of gooseberries. Not very much going on. I would like more power & character. Mouthfeel: Dry. Residual sugar content is 1,6 grams per litre. ABV is 13%. Medium plus acidity. Not worth the price in my opinion. Grape variety: 100% Chardonnay. Hand harvested grapes. Spontaneous fermentation using wild yeast. 50% malolactic fermented. Maturation in French oak barrels of which 15% were of new oak.

Ruby-red colour, aromas of red fruits, leather and chocolate. On palate is full bodied and very firm with fine tannins and flavours of vanilla and cedar. Finished strong and ripe.

Creamy honey on the nose, a bit of elderflower. Tasting palate distinctly different from the nose. Bright green apple, light minerality and effervescence.

4 g/l residual sugar. My first Sauvignon Blanc from Chile. Pale straw in color, faint passion fruit & minerality on the nose. Fruits open up on the palette - still a touch passion fruit with green apple / pear. Faint hints of the smokey minerality you get from a New Zealand variety - definitely a light Sauvignon Blanc. Nice medium acidic finish. Great value.

Simple but enjoyable red wine from the famous Mazzei winery. Pure sangiovese. A bit astringent still this 2016. May Be the use of young plants?

A nice, dark and robust Douro red. 12 months in oak and that shows! Right away lots of sweet oak on the nose. It quites down in the glass becoming more spicy, savoury, smoky. On the palate at first that oak continues. Strong chocolatw and coffee, with air more dark fruit and licorice spice, earthy notes. Firm, full-bodied, good but round harmonious tannins. Went well with a warming stew now that autumn is starting to present itself up here.

Was taken by surprise by the first notes of vanilla and wood, reminded me of Drew Estate Juicy Lucy cigars in my humidor. Tanins are notably present at first taste but so smooth that they diminish over time, dark berries, candy winegums, wood and vanilla blends nicely to make a flavorfull wine.

Simple wines have their place in time and space, after all, you do not want to drink $100 wine bottles every day! This is a simple Pinot Noir, but enjoyable precisely because of that. Fresh and crisp, blackberry and cherry notes come through easily. It has round tannins and a brief finish. An easy wine!

Good simple argentinian PN. Nice beautiful bright ruby color. Red fruits aromas. Medium body, and low tannins. Medium acidity, typical from this young wine.  Lots of red fruits, a bit of pepper, a bitter touch, and a medium finish. Portillo line from Salentein is a nice low cost product, for a party seens great, and a easy going wine for everybody. We paired it with chicken curry, and it went well. My other options were higher body... Salud!

Deep purple with ruby rims, an intoxicating fragrant, generously supple Shiraz/Cab Sauv blend. Dark fruits attack on the nose, cherry, blackberry, exotic and baking spices, undertones of cracked black pepper. Palate is robust and full bodied, spices dominate but revealing subtlety, mingling with red berry fruits, medium tannins, peppery finish with a dusting of cocoa. Aptly named. 4.0 52% Shiraz / 48% Cab Sauv

Prior to the Habs game tonight... Yay! We went for an early dinner at Tapas 24 in Montreal. They had an extensive Spanish wine list. Our waiter recommended this Toro that was quite interesting. We were a little hesitant on the year, but it was quite quaffable for a young wine. Dusty cherry, ripe cassis and smoke with lots of chalky tannins. Medium acidity. It paired well with our variety of Spanish dishes. 3.8 ✨

Afincado is the leading Cabernet Sauvignon from the fabulous stable of Terrazas de los Andes. Los Aromos is a single vineyard of very old CS in Perdriel. It is 3200ft above sea level and tit produces fruit of immense concentration and character. The Afincado is a master-class in the veiety. Dark ruby with enticing nose of blackcurrant, red pepper , sweet , caramel and toasty oak. The palate is big cassis showcase! Wild bramble and more blackcurrant. Velvet smooth with enough acidity to age for 10-15 yrs.

Roses & Violets with a smokey wood coming through and a touch of black olive. Full bodied with relatively soft tannins and some alcohol heat on the palate.

Very good wine with excellent price/quality combination. We had this one at 1* restaurant Kokkeriet in Kopenhagen. In the nose some horse stables (maybe funny, but true). We paired it with duck, pumpkin structures and smoked eel, very nice!

I was in between 3.7 and 3.8 but decided on 3.8 because of the QPR Ruby red color with thin fast legs Fruity nose has sour cherries, cranberries and some sweet spices Palate has superb mineralization, med - tannins and fruity taste Aftertaste is long and has good minerality

Really getting into Nero d'avola now that the evenings are getting cooler here in Sydney and the dinners are changing. Dark red brown black in the glass. Slightly cloudy. Palate is bold and arresting. Lots of licorice and prune and heavy spice. Palate is a mixture of cranberries and wild strawberry sweetness along with morello cherry in alcohol tang. The pitted prune flavour comes through on the palate too. Good depth of flavour. Allspice throughout. Nice dry meaty finish to it. Well worth a try.

Excellent wine tasted at Casa Flora at the Luccarelli Event. Made with 100% Primitivo from Puglia. Aged for 6 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, cocoa, tobacco, spices and vanilla. On the palate medium + body, structured, good complexity although young, good acidity. Velvety tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!

Damn, not sure if 4.5 or 5.0 anyway I love this juice. This product is awesome vintage after vintage. No sharp edges or anything though lacking the opulence of an Italian flagship or so. Please, if you manage to find a label like this anywhere please buy it. Cheers!! P.S. -> if you see the cork you’d NEVER say this wine is what it is.

Wow. Not an overwhelming experience like the Malbec, but, still, a extremely pleasant CabSav.! Mr. Catena hardly disappoints, and this is another great wine. Bold hints of smoked spices and black pepper, plums, leather, a very persistent oak scent on the aftertaste and a very complex and long tannin profile.

Was taken by surprise by the first notes of vanilla and wood, reminded me of Drew Estate Juicy Lucy cigars in my humidor. Tanins are notably present at first taste but so smooth that they diminish over time, dark berries, candy winegums, wood and vanilla blends nicely to make a flavorfull wine.

Red berries, peppery on the nose. Bit like a French Syrah but without the high tannins. Long finish. Medium wine with dark berries in the taste, almost floral too. Excellent value and a real easy drinker

Not your typical oaky Alentejo but with touch of sweetness that makes this wine a great value for the money.

Nice simple everyday Portuguese wine from the Dão, a deep dark carmine-garnet color with purple shade. Nose: sweet red fruit, black foresf berries, spices, cocoa nuance, some earthy notes, and dry grass. Wine balanced, medium body, with a pleasant fruity finish.

Lime and grapefruit on the nose. Mid weight with any citrus flavour very much in the background as the acidity dominates. A wine to drink during a meal. On reflection I've increased my rating to 4 stars as it's a subtle and well crafted wine.

A nice, dark and robust Douro red. 12 months in oak and that shows! Right away lots of sweet oak on the nose. It quites down in the glass becoming more spicy, savoury, smoky. On the palate at first that oak continues. Strong chocolatw and coffee, with air more dark fruit and licorice spice, earthy notes. Firm, full-bodied, good but round harmonious tannins. Went well with a warming stew now that autumn is starting to present itself up here.

Basically the traditional Mouchão 2002 with the addition of being kept in the producers cellar until its fit for optimum consumption. The usual black ripe fruit nose with balsamic,light wood and dark chocolate notes.Full palate of jam and ripe fruit,vanilla and figs,wood and almonds...balsamic. The full body gives way to a very persistent end with good acidity filling the palate.There is a trapped spirit in the bottle that makes you eat and drink more.Be very careful!!!!

Yet another one from this weekend's festivities... I had to add a Merlot to this mix, you understand. Nice smooth texture with ripe black cherry, blueberry, spices and a lingering undertone of leather. There's a depth to the layers even though the structure remains fairly simple. Slight floral aromas drift upwards in the finish, coupled with silky tannins and rich oak. At this price point, I have to go with an extra star. This needs no pairing at all and definitely lands on my wishlist for the future.

STORE TASTING - SAMPLE One of our favorites at the tasting! First, how can you go wrong with Alsace? This wine brightly shines of youth but with a subtle edge. From beginning to end, I savored this for a long time into the finish. It gave me a big bowl of island fruits (kiwi!) with enough acid & mineral balance to impress. Aromas of lychee, acacia & white lily flowers teased the nose long before the lips touched the glass. Such fun to discover this one!

NOBLE WHITE GRAPES “Gentil” refers to the blending of Alsace’s noble white grape varietals: Pinot Blanc + Sylvaner 50%, and the other half split with Riesling, Gewurtzraminer, Pinot Gris, and Muscat, hand harvested & barrel-fermented as is the Alsace tradition. Rather than it being a hot muddled mess, the wine is a stunning whole where each varietal played an integral part. Aromatic & grapey, refreshing & a little spicy, fruity at the start but growing more nuanced as it warms up in the glass. So good!👌🏻

88 pts Antinori delivers again and improved slightly since I tasted this vintage a year ago. Chianti is a beautiful workhorse, strong, dependable, when well chosen it's elegantly cast. Cool red fruit, leather, mushroom and herbs, classic Sangiovese. The palate has weight after an hour, good depth and mid length, a finish that is swathed in fruit. Excellent balance.

Kicking off the Christmas weekend with this beauty. One of the best Chianti's I've had, an enticing nose of ripe cherry with pine cone, winter spice and anise. Juicy palate of dark fruit with bold acidity. Huge savoury qualities; mushroom, leather and dried herbs. Superb tannin, refined and slightly chewy. Oh yes, We have all got a big smile on my face right now!

Very good representation of how great a Chianti Classico gets. Medium ruby colour with tainted legs. Pronounced aromas of sour cherry,leather, mocha, dusty minerality and fennel. Medium plus body, alcohol and acid. Round, dusty tannins, balanced and complex palate and long finish. 4

3.9+ Blind Tasting Pale Gold.Pear,Citrus,Nuts(Almond),Honey,Butter. Medium(+). Medium acidity,a bit oily and some part reminds me Alsace…and either Sauternes. But this should be Chardonnay. But I have no idea about the region...May be Southern France??Or Italy?🤔 It's Mario Schiopetto !50% Chardonnay 50% Friulano! Last year I do blind tasting for this winery and guessed it Alsace.This time,Chardonnay saves me😂

Lovely! Aromatic, well-balanced , rounded and long finish with medium acidity and tannins. Great on its own and with food. Easy to drink. However, drink up fast as it plunges and turns highly acidic in about 40 mins from opening.

88.Stuffed and consistent ruby, with an intense and variegated nose with scents of red and black fruits under the spirit among which cherry, blueberry and black currant stand out, with peppery notes in the background. In the mouth it is fruity with intense spicy notes of coffee and licorice. A vibrant tannic texture, decisive but not aggressive, the alcohol content is well tempered by an excellent acidity and discreet sapidity. The body is full and the finish is soothing, balsamic and long. Excellent price.

The bouquet is pleasant, open and full, with hints of white fruit, grapefruit, slightly spicy, with some hints of mint and a hint of anise and fennel. The taste is full, with a slightly spicy attack of ripe white fruit, a hint of fennel. The finish has a good length. Quite nice with our Mussels & Oysters.

You go all the way to Ecuador, find an excellent Ecuadorian restaurant to try the local cuisine, and you get a wine pair that originated only a couple of hours from home! An honest if unspectacular Chardonnay, lots of normal chardonnayness with green apples, a touch of lemon rind and some butter at the end. Would have been fine with a neighbourhood taverna fish of the day, but alongside the interesting food at URKO it was a bit of a let down. I know wine is expensive in Ecuador... so don't serve wine.

Las Brisas Single Vineyard is Leyda's top wine denomination. Love their stuff. There's always great value in them. Had the 2008 vintage and absolutely loved it. Decided to try a younger vintage. Even though this one is still developing in the bottle, it's very good. Complex nose of guava, spices, cloves, leather, wood and some sugar kane as well. It just keeps unravelling on the glass. Smooth palate, delicate and charming. Good finish with some guava and tea. Delightful.

Not expecting too much as generally not a fan of Chilean wine so pleasantly surprised when opened this. Plenty of cherries and raspberries with hints of plum and fig. This is a full bodied Pinot high in alchohol but not tasting such and packed with quite a long finish. Wine that makes you happy without costing very much has to go on the reorder list! Probably not a 4 star wine but a 3.75!

Very good wine tasted at the Grand Tasting 2018 of the Grand Cru. Made with 100% Cabernet Franc from Loire Valley. Fermented in temperature controlled in stainless steel tanks. Without passage through a wooden barrel. Aromas of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, blueberry, spices and floral. On the palate medium body, structured, well balanced, good acidity. Soft tannins. Ends with good persistence. Aging potential 3-4 years. I recommend!

Nice Portuguese cork, branded with winery name in a tower alike figure, with a red brown top and some cristal from exposure to cold weather. Nose for cherries and some alcohol breath. Very intense palate, explosive, from central mouth to the sides, cherries, sour finishing. Decent wine, not too hard to drink, with a good aftertaste.

Grand Tasting 2019 Grand Cru Fortaleza 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Outstanding wine! One of the best Cabernet Sauvignon I have tried from Argentina! 13,4% ABV; unnoticeable, very integrated. Acidity is balanced. Easy to drink. Single vineyard from San José, Tupungato. Smooth texture. Aged for 10 months in French oak. Flavors of blackberry, pepper, oak, cherry and vanilla. Aromas of dark fruits, oak, strawberry and cinnamon.

Now this is class. The nose is a cherry overdose that invites you to treat your palate to an ever changing taste sensation with every sip - all excellent however. Hints of blackberry, dark chocolate, vanilla all embraced by a wisp of oak. Elegant, refined. Great.

Always a treat when the sommelier complements you on your choice of bottle. 😏 Classy wine. Bright strawberry dominates. Background leather. Beautifully refined Nebbiolo tannins. Paired great with a burrata-prosciutto-endive salad followed up by a pastrami-crusted pork tenderloin. 😋

To keep the record I’ve tried this amazing wine on CR7 sister’s restaurant in Gramado, Brazil. Very fresh and outstanding nose. Tropical fruits, grass, countryside aromas, earth. As well as melon, peach. On the palate a little dry with notes of grapefruit, citrus, lemon. Match perfectly with CR7 favorite dish - Bacalhau. A good combination of acidity and fresh fruits. Medium finish!

And at the same small wine bar, we ordered some glasses of red wine, starting with this CC from Poggio Bonelli. We had this pairing a small cheese and meat platter, which was a great match. On the nose a fruity and stale red, with dark and some red fruity aroma's, a hint of acidity, and a pretty alcoholic edge (14%). The taste is smooth, with blackberries, warm ripe cherries, cedar wood, hints of vanilla, a smokey edge, and hints of plum. A soft acidity, medium tannins, and medium-long finish. Nice! 3.6

Deep dark dry cherry colour. The nose starts with a dramatic toasted oak and complex dark berry tones. Very pleasing. The smooth dark berry and medium tannin flavour carries on throughout. A very enjoyable wine. If you can get it for $20 or less Ca then it’s even better. Don’t hesitate to get this one by the case if the price is right. It will only get better!

This winery is owned by Allegrini, much more famous for their wines in the Valpolicella region (Amarone etc). The Rubio is a blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot, and 5% Cab Franc. No detailed notes.

On nose, it gives pronouced black cherry, blackberry, vanilla note, white flower, dried grape skin aroma; on palate, it is a dry, high acidity, quite astringent high tannin and full body wine, which its black fresh fruit comes first and then follow by dried grape skin and raisin aromas, giving a long finish. A bone dry Portugal red wine with great structure in its price range, can't see any necessary to age and can be enjoyed now.

Casablanca Valley, to the west of Santiago, is a decent wine region due to it's location between the coastal mountains and the pacific and it's varied soils and aspects. Pinot Noir is the most planted black grape variety, in sites well cooled by morning fogs, afternoon winds and altitude. This one is light ruby, with a nose of raspberry, strawberry and smoke. The palate is light and dry, medium(+) acidity, low tannins. 13%ABV, although feels less. Simple but flavoursome, enjoyed lightly chilled in the sun.

Clean, minerally sauvignon gris. Very slight petillance, just enough to lift the mouthfeel into an interesting place. Grapefruit and gooseberry, with a slightly sharp pineapple aftertaste. Good acid balance.

Our first Sauv Gris, very likely. Very good, though much like a Sauv Blanc, except maybe the very pale yellow colour. Ripe exotic fruit aromas (guava, passion fruit) dominate, and combine nicely with white pepper. Nice finish as well. A wine we would gladly drink again

Always fun to try a Sauvignon Gris, this one was particularly enjoyable. Sampled by the glass in Barrica 94 last week before meeting with fellow Vivinoer Jean Sendero. Nose of asparagus, lemon. Zesty palate with racey acidity, tart citrus and vegetal notes. 4.0

Think this is really good, especially for this price. Sangiovese with Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah. It has the acidity, focus and tension of an Italian wine, with added roundness and generosity coming from the international grapes. Lovely, with good complexity and concentration while remainig accessible.

Wow. Interesting nose. Weird blue cheese funkiness and very floral. Geranium in particular. Colour is very clear with a dark blood red hue. Palate is thin like my hair, but a strong core of sour cherries and maybe even olives. Astringent but not strongly so, soft and lingering finish. Good drinking with salami, cheese and savories.

Very deep purple color that you can't see thru it. His color has also notes of milk chocolate, with a ruby edge and fast drop legs. On the nose first a High mature prunes smell, combine with chocolate and a soft touch of leather, some sugar and no alcohol is feel on the nose. High fruity flavor on the mouth, soft and pleasant tannins, tasty is the word that brings to my mind this wine. High Extended aftertaste. Cheers!🧐

Pure ruby in colour, with brambly red fruit and herbs on the nose. Don't let the pale ruby colour fool you, this is a powerful wine. Structured and firm tannin, with warm alcohol, the wine shows plenty of red fruit; cherry, raspberry and currant. The fruit is followed by a dusting of dried herb and leather, which should become more prominent with some age. Great now, but will definitely improve with a few more years.

My answer to a rainy day... Crack open a good Bordeaux blend and savor. Let the rain sing to you! Dark and rich blends of red and dark fruit, cigar tobacco, spices and sweet oak create a simple, but richly bold, interplay on the palate. The cigar aromas really get intense and the spices simplify into cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Good depth which expands with time. Chewy tannins dominate the finish with traces of oak peaking through. Going to be a good day!!!

Simple wines have their place in time and space, after all, you do not want to drink $100 wine bottles every day! This is a simple Pinot Noir, but enjoyable precisely because of that. Fresh and crisp, blackberry and cherry notes come through easily. It has round tannins and a brief finish. An easy wine!

Racy acidity and polished firm tannins with dark berries on palate. Fullbodied and complex extralong spicy finish.Top texture. Needs an hour aeration and benefits surely much longer cellaring.

Wonderful alvarinho, produced from the old vines with partial aging in oak. Tropical aromas of pineapple and yellow melon. Exciting zesty palate with elegant acidity and a structured mineral finish with lemon peel

Super elegant. 👃 is peach, apple and wood. Floral notes. Mouth is peach, long, elegant, sticky to your toung. Open the bottle 3 0 minutes before drinking. Be very careful to open and drink wine at the good not too cold temperature. This way you get the most of the nose and mouth.

Still very young. Rich, dark, tannic, concentrated, with good acidity and huge potential. The wine is robust and complex, no polish, no compromises, 95 Parker, and I understand why. The style of the house is a bit old fashioned, naive in terms of business, very straightforward and true to terroir. Great value. 4.2

I’m not getting this wine it seems. 95 p from old man Parker but all I’m getting are overwhelming tannins and not nearly enough fruit. Body and finish are top notch though. Can it be the relatively young age?

Not bad at all! Good wine Beautiful ruby red color. The nose is complex, showing fruits like blackberries and raspberries, with hints of vanilla and tobacco. An expressive palate is potent yet fresh, touched with chocolate and mocha, and a good concentration of ripe tannins. Well balanced, with a long, pleasant finish. Solid 4 stars Cheers friend enjoy the weekend

Let's talk about a real wine. 100% Teróldego tried at Vallontado. Aromas of red fruits, plums, pitangas, wild strawberries, red roses, earthy touch, tobacco and coffee grounds. Vibrant palate, firm tannin, fine, elegant and delicate. Shows balance. Full body and vigorous, but of an incredible softness, presenting velvety character and pleasant texture. Slight minerality and persistent finish

Intense and deep purple color. How this is a non filtered wine, I have opened the bottle and wait it rest in a decanter for around hour and half. On the nose dark plum, cassis, blue florals and tobacco smoke. Medium bodied, natural, lifted, with very fine tannins that turn raging on the finish. Very interesting experience.

Dry. Reduce in recipes in place of a sherry, and have a taste yourself while cooking. Thankfully lower alcohol than many Chilean whites and not too acidic. Great price point. Use when your food is spicy and complex, with lots of strong green herbs and garlic and there are many dishes on the table and everyone is smiling. It'll keep the smiles.

A bit acidic at first but decanting or running it through an aerator is needed. Afterwards, nice tannins mix well with dark fruits (blackberry and blueberry), subtle spices and hint of smoke. I paired with a pork tenderloin and sweet potatoes; pairing worked very well with the sweet and salty.

Belo Chardonnay catarinense. Coloração amarelo palha com reflexos dourados. Notas de abacaxi, maçã verde, tostado e leve mineral. Em boca um vinho com boa untuosidade, amanteigado, ótima acidez equilibrado e um final de boca agradável e persistente. Pelo custo vale 4*. Saúde!!!

Pale yellow color. Nose on this is strong, with crisp apple and floral notes. On the palate, very herbaceous with a lingering citrus and tart pear finish - notable minerality and acidity

Good wine tasted at the ViniBraExpo 2018, but not enthusiastic the fan of the grape. Made with 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Campos de Cima da Serra. Aged in stainless steel tanks. Aromas of cassis, blackberry, plum, herbaceous and menthol. On the palate medium body, good structure and acidity. Soft tannins. Medium finish!

A crowd pleaser and champion among its peers, this charismatic Burgundian is both the nice guy and class jock. While in a league of its own, it is coveted by all. Given its reputable namesake, this Pinot does not disappoint and is faithful to its Côte Chalonnaise origins. This 2012 vintage packs a big, fruity punch of red fruits and spices, but finishes with refined tannins. With wild mushroom, plums, sweet cherries and star anise qualities, this is one appellation not to be overlooked.

My first Brazilian wine thanks to my good friend Roberto Bassan. Owned by an Italian family who immigrated to Brazil in 1897 and named their wine after the land they moved in at the time. 2012 Lote 43 is a very well made wine, kept 12 months in French Oak, 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet, has a seductive complex nose, ruby red in color, full bodied, rich, jammy yet has a soft and velvety texture, lots of black fruits, tobacco, leather. Roberto- you have to come to Istanbul more often ! Cheers to you amigo 🍷

Big and rich styled Sangio. First impression licorice and spice followed with dark cherry aromas, expected a monster in the glass. Wine balanced right out with rustic elegance. Cherry, earth, hint of leather backed with nice acid and easy tannin. Bigger than your typical Chianti but maintaining character of Sangiovese.

I’m starting to enjoy these alvarinhos! Who wouldn’t enjoy the wooden notes, a floral whiff and a little stone fruit in the nose. On the palate you have subtle zesty citrus, mixed up with tones of wood. The pleasant “sur lie” effect is a little cherry on top! What a harmonious wine!4,1⭐️

This is a blend of carignan, syrah, and malbec. The name comes from the tin cups used during the Age of Exploration; an aliara was a cup's worth of ration. The nose is wonderful with blueberry, strawberry, and rose perfumes. In the glass, a squeeze of mandarin orange stands in for acidity, and a stringy, pulpy mouthfeel kicks in, much like the texture of persimmon.

Another masterpiece of the Salentein. Cabernet Sauvignon aged 18 months in French oak barrels. Deep violet color. Bouquet reminiscent of cassis with hints is pepper and spices. In the mouth intense and elegant, black fruits and lots of pepper notes. Well structured with firm tannins but at the same time sweet and silky. A final of unique complexity, crisp and persistent.

(4.5*) Dinner with Fabio Souza, Edi Mazoni, Haroldo Rodrigues, Michael Alvarez and Luis Fabiano Marin at Rascal. Fabulous Argentinean Cabernet Sauvignon, one of the best of the night in my opinion. I tasted a few bottles of this Primus line and always I had a great experience with those wines. Aged for 18 months in French oak, perfectly balanced, complex aromas of ripe red fruits, black currants, tobacco and vanilla. On palate is rich and dense, structured and elegant with good volume and persistence.

91 pts 2012 is their next release of this good Sicilian rosso from Faro DOC, around Messina. Aromas of chocolate and plums with good length, drying tannins and med+ alc. Elegant and should age well. Love the style as always.

It offers up a captivating bouquet of sandalwood, Asian spices, incense, floral notes, black plum, and blackberry. This sets the stage for a full-bodied, dense, plush, full-flavored, incipiently complex Carmenere that has the balance and structure to evolve for several more years.

I am continually impressed by the consistent quality and elegance of this Carmenere. A worry successor and follow up to its delicious 2011 sibling. Blue and black berries, vanilla oak with the telltale herbaceous note. Vibrant texture, sweet velvet tannins, medium+ body, ripe acidity. Long finish. Ready to drink now but I believe there is some upside in giving this 3+ years. Paired with pork belly and grilled shrimp. Viva Carmenérè! Viva Chile!

Inky deep garnet hue like an octopus just left my glass. Nose of wet gravel and plum that opens with a red pepper, raspberry sauce then a dry middle that transitions into long tangy finish of herbs, sweet tobacco and red plum. Paired with prime top sirloin, baked potato and almond green beans. This big red represents the primal basics...no soft complex notes here, just a big red kick of Cab Franc!

88 pts Antinori delivers again and improved slightly since I tasted this vintage a year ago. Chianti is a beautiful workhorse, strong, dependable, when well chosen it's elegantly cast. Cool red fruit, leather, mushroom and herbs, classic Sangiovese. The palate has weight after an hour, good depth and mid length, a finish that is swathed in fruit. Excellent balance. Marvelous for €15.

Kicking off the Christmas weekend with this beauty. One of the best Chianti's I've had, an enticing nose of ripe cherry with pine cone, winter spice and anise. Juicy palate of dark fruit with bold acidity. Huge savoury qualities; mushroom, leather and dried herbs. Superb tannin, refined and slightly chewy. Oh yes, We have all got a big smile on my face right now!

88.Stuffed and consistent ruby, with an intense and variegated nose with scents of red and black fruits under the spirit among which cherry, blueberry and black currant stand out, with peppery notes in the background. In the mouth it is fruity with intense spicy notes of coffee and licorice. A vibrant tannic texture, decisive but not aggressive, the alcohol content is well tempered by an excellent acidity and discreet sapidity. The body is full and the finish is soothing, balsamic and long. Excellent price.

A new discovery for me. Lovers of classic, traditionally crafted Sangiovese should seek this out. Gorgeous red fruits backed by a spine of bright acidity and framed in silky, fine grained tannins. I love the clean, precise and beautifully delineated flavors. The high altitude fruit is evident here. I’m an instant fan.

Scent: Vanilla, mineral, soil, soy sauce, boiled rise and a hint of leather. Medium intensity. Quite enjoyable and fairly original. Looks: Medium to light red. Almost like a Pinot Noir. Mouthfeel: Dry. Alcohol content equals 13%. Medium bodied. High acidity. Some sour cherries on the palate. Pairs well together with pasta dishes or pizza. Very overpriced, at least according to myself.

The estate dates back to the Crusades, and Scottish navigator, George Smith, the owner in the 18th century. He was followed by M. Duffour-Dubergier, Mayor of Bordeaux, and then Louis Eschenauer, a famous wine shipper. In 1990, Daniel and Florence Cathiard now own the estate. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, darrk berry aromas, herb and spice. On the palate complex juicy black fruit flavors, cinnamon and cacao notes. Soft tannins, rich and full, lingering, mineral, youthful ending, needs time.

This would have to be one the most simple and easy whites I have had, and devoid of any objectionable elements The price was a steal at $15.00 AUD This is a floral and aromatic drop The nose is white citrus, pear. The palate is lineal, crisp, white stone fruit, pear, lime, honeysuckle, the fine acid running along the full length just makes it such a great quencher Recommended..

Mango, honey, pineapple, complex of tropical fruits, with white flower in hint, and long after taste. I am amazed that Chablis could perform in such a round shape. Mid-high acidity, well balanced. I was eating Hakka food (one of traditional Taiwan food) and it matches well. Really enjoy the food and meal today.

Great Rutini .... blend Cab-Malbec once againg... and again what a pleasure this red... 2016 is mybe best vintage ever of this USD$ 15 red. 92 pts Decanter Silver medal... I love this fresh deep red, speacially cause its not Cab nor Malbec... guess it keeps qualities of both grapes and improves them both. Bought for R$ 80... justifies another half star... Monster value!! Excellent as allways!!

This one deserves a nice review. Very well balanced wine. Aromas of strawberries and blackberries and a bit of vanilla. On the palate, strong presence of tannins, but not overwhelmingly. Acidity just in the right point to balance it and make it very smooth to drink. One of the best (if not the best so far) wines from Argentina I have ever tasted. Would rate it a 4.3 or 4.4.

3.9 Big blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec to start the week on Monday. Brunello on Tuesday!!! 😋😋😀😀 Nice lustrous almandine garnet red color with intense purple undertones. Good distinctive aromas of cranberry, eucalyptus, tobacco and licorice. The palate offered strong tannins but short while the acidity nicely developed a mouthwatering ambiance for the fruits to convey their flavors. With time it developed raspberry flavors.

Good wine, but deceived by the 93 points of la Cav. Would compare well with a wine for 15-18,000 CLP ($20-25 US), but not an iconic wine. Well made, beautiful color, nice aromas and flavors, but we are still waiting for something special......

4.3 Beautiful, deep, bright violet red color with ruby hues. Very aromatic and fresh. Reminds of raspberries, cherries and pomegranates accompanied by violet notes. It unwinds elegantly revealing soft spicy notes such as white pepper, strawberries, blueberries, bitter chocolate and a soft truffle note that stands out. A wine with silky tannins, great persistence, finesse and elegance.

Many layers in this glass! Strong fruit: roasted cherry and plum with hints of orange, cork, cedar, anise, lemongrass, and cardamom. Deepens with food, though that also brings up as you dive down. Strawberry notes join the cherry in the glass, as does the suggestion of vanilla.

This wine had the duty to follow up on the super 'lirac - la ferme romaine'. So I had my doubts if this would even come close. I was in for a surprise... Grenache 80%, Syrah 10%, Mourvèdre 10% of which 30% was raised for 10 months in barrels. A compairable structure, but a more feminim, elegant version. Smooth beginning and than the structured, layered explosion; coffee, black fruit, silky tannines. Lovely aftertaste. Exquisit! 18/20

CNDP is such a gamble! Nice wine but I’m extra grateful to have received this as a gift as the value for money is questionable. Nice wine - but for how much?! Vivino is going to put regions like CNdP under serious pressure to deliver more. Nice wine for $70 just doesn’t make sense when can get superb wine for $35.

Intense ruby red color in the glass! On the nose intense bouquet of black berries with plums! On the palate soft and lively with good length and mineral notes, soft and noble tannins with a long finish! Cheers!

A miraculous recovery from a shocker vintage More savoury and slightly green...but a brooding monster Middle palate tastes like aged balsamic from ages barrels ....they aged it for 21 months in barrel Mediterranean spicing with wild roadside herbs Powerful Sangiovese acids blended with jammy cherry Demonstrates its terroir and varietal elegance Super value Will cellar and get better and better

88 pts Antinori delivers again and improved slightly since I tasted this vintage a year ago. Chianti is a beautiful workhorse, strong, dependable, when well chosen it's elegantly cast. Cool red fruit, leather, mushroom and herbs, classic Sangiovese. The palate has weight after an hour, good depth and mid length, a finish that is swathed in fruit. Excellent balance. Marvelous for €15.

Kicking off the Christmas weekend with this beauty. One of the best Chianti's I've had, an enticing nose of ripe cherry with pine cone, winter spice and anise. Juicy palate of dark fruit with bold acidity. Huge savoury qualities; mushroom, leather and dried herbs. Superb tannin, refined and slightly chewy. Oh yes, We have all got a big smile on my face right now!

88.Stuffed and consistent ruby, with an intense and variegated nose with scents of red and black fruits under the spirit among which cherry, blueberry and black currant stand out, with peppery notes in the background. In the mouth it is fruity with intense spicy notes of coffee and licorice. A vibrant tannic texture, decisive but not aggressive, the alcohol content is well tempered by an excellent acidity and discreet sapidity. The body is full and the finish is soothing, balsamic and long. Excellent price.

A new discovery for me. Lovers of classic, traditionally crafted Sangiovese should seek this out. Gorgeous red fruits backed by a spine of bright acidity and framed in silky, fine grained tannins. I love the clean, precise and beautifully delineated flavors. The high altitude fruit is evident here. I’m an instant fan.

Scent: Vanilla, mineral, soil, soy sauce, boiled rise and a hint of leather. Medium intensity. Quite enjoyable and fairly original. Looks: Medium to light red. Almost like a Pinot Noir. Mouthfeel: Dry. Alcohol content equals 13%. Medium bodied. High acidity. Some sour cherries on the palate. Pairs well together with pasta dishes or pizza. Very overpriced, at least according to myself.

Excellent wine tasted at Casa Flora at the Luccarelli Event. Made with 100% Primitivo from Puglia. Aged for 6 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, cocoa, tobacco, spices and vanilla. On the palate medium + body, structured, good complexity although young, good acidity. Velvety tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!

Damn, not sure if 4.5 or 5.0 anyway I love this juice. This product is awesome vintage after vintage. No sharp edges or anything though lacking the opulence of an Italian flagship or so. Please, if you manage to find a label like this anywhere please buy it. Cheers!! P.S. -> if you see the cork you’d NEVER say this wine is what it is.

I’m starting to enjoy these alvarinhos! Who wouldn’t enjoy the wooden notes, a floral whiff and a little stone fruit in the nose. On the palate you have subtle zesty citrus, mixed up with tones of wood. The pleasant “sur lie” effect is a little cherry on top! What a harmonious wine!4,1⭐️

A combination of grapes from both Russian River and Alexander Valley give this Zinfandel its distinctive aroma and taste. Russian River brings forth bright, fresh notes of fruit, with Alexander Valley contributing its bold, peppery compliments. With 16 months aging in both French and American oak, you’re looking at a medium rich, fruit ‘jammy’ forward, peppery delight.

Bright ruby red in hue, translucent light body, Cherry jam on the nose w/a slight hint of Italian herbs. Soft, fruity & balanced with a bright fresh finish.

Happy to finally try this Spanish blend after hearing so much about it. This reinforces my positive experience in exploring Spanish wines outside of the popular Rioja region (I'm a big fan of the reds from Montsant, Priorat and Ribero del Duero). A big wine but with smoothed out tannins, spice and mocha flavours mid palate. I need to try this with some BBQ. #365daysofvino

I've been handed this task a number of times and honestly, it's really, really hard to do. Good news! This 2012 Solanera is the ticket. Beautifully crafted with rich and bold flavors of black currant, blackberry, exotic spice and smoke. Backed with firm tannins and acidity to match.

Caro, from Catena and Rothschild , has a strong identity , characterized by the Malbec grape, which is given further complexity trough blending with Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose recalls eucalyptus and dried fruit aromas, combined with hints of crushed plum, dried orange peel,roasted coffee and chocolate brownie scents. The wine evolves slowly in the glass , with several layers of flavors , and a unique mouthfeel of outstanding complexity.

Not overly expressive first nose. Once the wine has had some time to breathe, it’s a delight: complex nose, with hints of vanilla, oak, truffle with earthy notes. Palate has licorice, even some raisin. There is complexity, elegance and smoothness, both with red meat and on its own. Balance is divine, between soft tannins and a spot on acidity. 9,5 sec PAI. Outstanding.

A lush and linear offering from Trimbach. The Gewürztraminer 2013 is pale lemon yellow and visibly viscous in the glass. As is typical of the variety, it's aromatic—a kaleidoscope of white peach, mango, under-ripe pineapple, spice and a whiff of kerosene that blew off after an hour. The attack is mouthfilling, round, and moderately sweet. An acid spine arches through glycerolly layers—my favorite part of this wine is the finish. Wet stones, schist, and saline that builds towards a mouthwatering end.

Smooth, well balanced and intense- notes of cooked pear, warm strawberry jam and vanilla. There some woodsy notes but they are minimal. Very easy to drink and relaxing. A great Malbec.

A warm nose of forest fruits and hearty oak. Full bodied hit of deepening tones from cherry to blackcurrant turning to bramble on the finish with a rounded tannin that carries the weight you expect of a Malbec. An excellent value proposition.

A great assemblage wine... Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Syrah and Cabernet Franc ... dark purple, with great character. At first nose black fruits (cherry, blackberry and cassis), some vanilla, and chocolate, at the end. After a while, one can feel some spices, like cloves. At mouth, very fruity, acidity well balanced. Good tannins as well. Very nice to drink with meat, cheese ... recommend

Pure ruby in colour, with brambly red fruit and herbs on the nose. Don't let the pale ruby colour fool you, this is a powerful wine. Structured and firm tannin, with warm alcohol, the wine shows plenty of red fruit; cherry, raspberry and currant. The fruit is followed by a dusting of dried herb and leather, which should become more prominent with some age. Great now, but will definitely improve with a few more years.

My answer to a rainy day... Crack open a good Bordeaux blend and savor. Let the rain sing to you! Dark and rich blends of red and dark fruit, cigar tobacco, spices and sweet oak create a simple, but richly bold, interplay on the palate. The cigar aromas really get intense and the spices simplify into cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Good depth which expands with time. Chewy tannins dominate the finish with traces of oak peaking through. Going to be a good day!!!

Viva la France Mövenpick winetasting #1. As new 2015 vintage of Bordeaux has arrived, this time we focused mostly on red. This wine shows a bit more age and develops very nice. On the nose intensive deep ripe fruits - plums and cherries, vanilla, chocolate, notes of lacorice, with developing mushrooms and tabacco. On the palate the wine is quite fruity, with considerable amount of already rounded tannins, balancing acidity, coffee, chocolate, long aftertaste. Although not the best vintage, it is great!

I enjoyed it so much.... ! plenty and intensive aromas of black and red fruits, black chocolate , coffee, pepper, hints of oak, tobacco, liquorice overrun your palate in a medium-full body and medium-long aftertaste sensation with smooth finish. Well structured wine , well rounded with silky tannins. I combined it with barbecued meats and it was really very good.

Excellent wine tasted at Casa Flora at the Luccarelli Event. Made with 100% Primitivo from Puglia. Aged for 6 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, plum, blackberry, cocoa, tobacco, spices and vanilla. On the palate medium + body, structured, good complexity although young, good acidity. Velvety tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!

November, '17. Dark and Dusty on the palate full concentration, stains the glass. dark dark Ruby, almost purple. Gorgeous. Dark tilled soil, tar, graphite, Cassis, licorice. Yes there is fruit and clearly this is a really complex wine. At $20 retail with 2 pounds of brisket or pot roast and you will be in heaven. At an industry tasting of less expensive wines -- everyday drinkers you can find your local grocery store. As well as some hidden gems.

Le doy media estrella más, porque es un vino de linea economíca que representa muy bien la variedad. Color amarillo verdoso, aromas a ananá y frutas tropicales. En boca tiene una acidez muy equilibrada, refrescante y con un final medio. I give it half a star more, because it is an economical wine that represents variety very well. Greenish yellow color, aromas of pineapple and tropical fruits. The palate has a very balanced acidity, refreshing and with a medium finish.

Simple wines have their place in time and space, after all, you do not want to drink $100 wine bottles every day! This is a simple Pinot Noir, but enjoyable precisely because of that. Fresh and crisp, blackberry and cherry notes come through easily. It has round tannins and a brief finish. An easy wine!

Good simple argentinian PN. Nice beautiful bright ruby color. Red fruits aromas. Medium body, and low tannins. Medium acidity, typical from this young wine.  Lots of red fruits, a bit of pepper, a bitter touch, and a medium finish. Portillo line from Salentein is a nice low cost product, for a party seens great, and a easy going wine for everybody. We paired it with chicken curry, and it went well. My other options were higher body... Salud!

Wednesday evening at home, mid-week wine break. I decided to open a wine I brought from my trip to Italy, last year. This interesting Italian-Argentinian, blend of Corvina and Malbec. 👁 Purplish red, purple shades. Plums, blackberries, violets, guava paste, mustard grains and earthy notes. 👄 Full bodied, high alcohol, medium acidity and loaded with tannins. Mouth filling texture, dense, but rounded. Dark currants, blueberries and menthol flavors. 4⭐️

Very attractive nose with herb, melon and grapefruit notes. The palate shows lovely rich flavours of passion fruit and melon, countered nicely by herb, citrus and green pepper notes. There’s a subtle chalky edge, too, which works really well. I love the balance between the fruit richness and the fresh grassy characters that this wine shows.

A beautiful white blend of Torrontes & Riesling; pale, straw pour. Aromatic nose is a thing of beauty showing honeysuckle, rose petal, white peach, nectarine, lemon peel & white pepper; very complex. Mostly dry, but has a touch of sweetness on entry superbly balanced by the tart, crisp acidity. Light bodied for summer sipping or pool lounging. Palate is grapefruit, lemon peel, citrus zest & nutmeg. Minerals, saline & pith start mid palate and continue through the long finish😻. For 8.99, this is a 3.8🌟👍.

This one deserves a nice review. Very well balanced wine. Aromas of strawberries and blackberries and a bit of vanilla. On the palate, strong presence of tannins, but not overwhelmingly. Acidity just in the right point to balance it and make it very smooth to drink. One of the best (if not the best so far) wines from Argentina I have ever tasted. Would rate it a 4.3 or 4.4.

A new discovery for me. Lovers of classic, traditionally crafted Sangiovese should seek this out. Gorgeous red fruits backed by a spine of bright acidity and framed in silky, fine grained tannins. I love the clean, precise and beautifully delineated flavors. The high altitude fruit is evident here. I’m an instant fan.

Scent: Vanilla, mineral, soil, soy sauce, boiled rise and a hint of leather. Medium intensity. Quite enjoyable and fairly original. Looks: Medium to light red. Almost like a Pinot Noir. Mouthfeel: Dry. Alcohol content equals 13%. Medium bodied. High acidity. Some sour cherries on the palate. Pairs well together with pasta dishes or pizza. Very overpriced, at least according to myself.

Intensive, ink-like purple, in thick consistency, this Dolcetto comes fruity and earthy in nose and palate. Aromas somewhat shy and reserved, probably owing to its only 1 year of age. Great tannins and acid, well balanced and with good body and finish. A very nice Dolcetto, that has his best times in the next 2-3 years. (Nov 2018).

Cherry (Amy Winehouse) Decent organic garnet red Chianti blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, with some red ripe cherries and oregano on the nose and more ripe cherries on the palate, balanced by young grainy tannins and a fresh acidity leading towards a mid-lengthy finish. Paired nicely with some pasta alla norma.

For the inner rock licker in all wine lovers. Decanted 30 minutes. Pale gold in the glass. The nose offers muted citrus, green melon and a hint of slate. The slate comes right to the front on the palate. This is a good example of what someone means when they say a wine tastes like licking a rock. The minerality is joined by the citrus and melon. The whole package is held together with well balanced acidity. Whilst I don’t normally get in to licking rocks this is a very good example of Chablis.

Yellow apple skin, Meyer lemon, and mushroom aromas that are oddly reminiscent of the cote du beaune, but with a certain saltiness in the background. I don’t pick up any oak, but seems to have spent time on its lees. No way I would have called this Chablis but I really like the wine just based on the merits of any Chardonnay, especially for the price. Would really like to try some of this producers higher end bottles

Excellent expression of north Italian Pinot Noir. The nose is complex with notes of red cherry, red berries, plum, licorice and spice from the cask. The palate is lean but textured, the pleasant freshness is well balanced by a slight sweetness and soft tannins which give a long complex finish.

This wine had the duty to follow up on the super 'lirac - la ferme romaine'. So I had my doubts if this would even come close. I was in for a surprise... Grenache 80%, Syrah 10%, Mourvèdre 10% of which 30% was raised for 10 months in barrels. A compairable structure, but a more feminim, elegant version. Smooth beginning and than the structured, layered explosion; coffee, black fruit, silky tannines. Lovely aftertaste. Exquisit! 18/20

CNDP is such a gamble! Nice wine but I’m extra grateful to have received this as a gift as the value for money is questionable. Nice wine - but for how much?! Vivino is going to put regions like CNdP under serious pressure to deliver more. Nice wine for $70 just doesn’t make sense when can get superb wine for $35.

Excellent expression of north Italian Pinot Noir. The nose is complex with notes of red cherry, red berries, plum, licorice and spice from the cask. The palate is lean but textured, the pleasant freshness is well balanced by a slight sweetness and soft tannins which give a long complex finish.

94pts. Pugnitello is an ancient and rare Tuscan grape that naturally produces low yields. For this reason, Tuscan wine producers of the past concentrated on Sangiovese instead, leaving Pugnitello for extinction. Recently rediscovered, the first new bottling of this grape came in 2003 and has been produced every year since except for in 2005. If tasted blind, I would have guessed a feminine style Brunello, perhaps Altesino. Beautiful red fruit, espresso, mocha and leather. Med+ acidity and medium tannins.

( 3,8 ) Very good wine tasted at the launch of Descorchados 2019. 92 RP and 90 JS. Made with 100% Malbec from Valle de Uco. Aged for 18 months, 50% in cement tanks, 25% in stainless steel vats and 25% in untoasted large oak foudres. Aromas of cherry, plum, raspberry, chocolate, herbs, smoked, mineral, spices and floral. On the palate medium body, structured, good complexity and acidity. Fine tannins. Ends with good persistence. Good value for money. I recommend with enthusiasm!

Nose of sour cherries and minerals immediately after uncorking. Medium high acids reminiscent of a Carignan in third gear. Smooth velvet flow to start and a green vegetal bite to finish. Props to the use of clay gredas in the ferment. I'm a homer for the upper palate mentholated complexity that it adds.

A dark purple colour, slightly tight vegetal nose with an extremely smooth palate breathing notes of chocolate, blackberry, cedar and leather. The tannins are very well integrated and the wine has lovely and unique characteristics made from less well known grapes including Grand Noir, Trincadeira and Aragonez. The wine was partially fermented in clay pots. A really interesting buy if you love a deep, rich, smooth and mellow red. Paired perfectly with grilled burgers.

Italian wine needs its time. Not like me, always in a hurry, always impatient. So is this young wine. I gave him half an hour, maybe an hour, I got good wine, with an impressive dark red color. But in the second half of the evening, a second taste reveals an impressive complex of aromas enveloping you in the aromas of the Piedmont hills, black and red fruits, spiced and ripe. Medium body, 13.5%, medium tannins and acidity and great finish, not long and slightly acidic. I Miss Pimonte..

(Magnum) That was a fun one.. opulent, oak driven but well in balance with the rest. Usually the first thing that comes to mind when I think about portoguese wine is „minerality“.. and thisone didn‘t fully brake the rule, but it had a creamyness that I’ve never had in a wine from that reagion. Pear, ripe peach, vanilla, almond.. beautifull inviting nose On the palate brought and with good preasure. A bit more vanilla, chashew and touch apple and pear. Integrated acidity. Ending in a mineral driven finish

The color of winter sunlight, Trimbach’s 2016 Reverve Riesling is made from old vines planted on the winery’s estate parcels notably classed as Grand Cru—these vineyards lie within ancient calcareous limestone soils studded with fossilized seashells known as “Muschelkalk.” A kaleidoscope of white peach, yellow apple, lemongrass, lemon pith, wet stone and kerosene. In the mouth it’s lithe and linear. White grapefruit, apricot pit, bitter almond twine bracing, racy acidity that hits the sides of the tongue.

A no brainer for breakfast pairing in an airport lounge. Nose is a touch austere. Scents of kiwi and rubber bands.. Palate is a rush of citrus and tropics. Kiwi, pineapple, lime zest, white flower. Piercing sharpness and high acidity emphasising the concentration and energy of the wine. Mouth-drying, eye-watering long finish. Yes, Trimbach produce many better wines than this. But even their huge production entry level is bloody great.

Great white wine tasted at the Grand Cru with friends before starting the Event One Night in Italy. Broglia is one of the most traditional producers in the region of Gavi. Considered an icon of the house. Made with 100% Cortese di Gavi. Without passing through wood. Aromas of peach, apple, pear, lemon, tangerine, almonds, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, structured, good complexity and acidity. Ends with great persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!

Beautfiul pale gold in the glass, the fruit on the nose jumps out like walking through a pear orchard. Lots of green apple and a hint of over-ripe yellow apple and elderflower. Light-medium bodied, this one is nicely dry and acidic, with a soft but persistent astringency. 4.1 ⭐️ from me. Deluxxe!

The estate dates back to the Crusades, and Scottish navigator, George Smith, the owner in the 18th century. He was followed by M. Duffour-Dubergier, Mayor of Bordeaux, and then Louis Eschenauer, a famous wine shipper. In 1990, Daniel and Florence Cathiard now own the estate. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, darrk berry aromas, herb and spice. On the palate complex juicy black fruit flavors, cinnamon and cacao notes. Soft tannins, rich and full, lingering, mineral, youthful ending, needs time.

This Toscana blend is quite typical, Sangiovese plus some Canaiolo, always present in Chiantis. This one, much softer than Chiantis, though. Aroma of raspberries, clove and dark chocolate. Mild tannins, medium body and acidity, easy to drink and to pair. Good wine. $ 25 in Brazil, probably half that elsewhere.

Viva la France Mövenpick winetasting #1. As new 2015 vintage of Bordeaux has arrived, this time we focused mostly on red. This wine shows a bit more age and develops very nice. On the nose intensive deep ripe fruits - plums and cherries, vanilla, chocolate, notes of lacorice, with developing mushrooms and tabacco. On the palate the wine is quite fruity, with considerable amount of already rounded tannins, balancing acidity, coffee, chocolate, long aftertaste. Although not the best vintage, it is great!

On the nose, aromas of black fruits – blackberries, black cherries, black plums – predominate with subtle notes of vanilla and dark chocolate intermingled with savory hints of green olive and a stony minerality. On the palate, the wine is tremendously complex, unfolding layer upon layer of red currant, eucalyptus, and black pepper flavors . Black cherries and blackberries give way to cassis followed by a hint of saline minerality.

Inviting, toast, pepper and spice scent. Such a rounded, silky mouthful of pear, pineapple, peach, with creamy richness, allied to a finesse that truly competes internationally.

A rich bold and very full on Chardonnay. No messing with this one lots of pear, green crisp apple, hints of pineapple, mint, and bitter kumquats. On the nose it's young oak, buttery and vanilla with grass silage. If you like a creamy Chardonnay with a medley of fruit, this is cracker. I was impressed.

Not as full bodied as typical cramenere but complex and very well balanced. Lot of dark fruits on the nose. The body of sour cherries and blackberries. Very long and very sophisticated finish with blackberries, cassis, and some bitter notes. The taste is subtle and unlike most crameneres is better going alone. The spicy food would shadow the nuances.

This would have to be one the most simple and easy whites I have had, and devoid of any objectionable elements The price was a steal at $15.00 AUD This is a floral and aromatic drop The nose is white citrus, pear. The palate is lineal, crisp, white stone fruit, pear, lime, honeysuckle, the fine acid running along the full length just makes it such a great quencher Recommended..

From the Piedmont EXPO in Oslo 30.Oct 2018. Grapes from the allegedly best vineyard in Gattinara; The Osso San Grato (planted in 1940). Nose of cherries, leather and dry-aged meat. Earthy minerality and spices on the palate. Exquisite mouthfeel. Fresh, structured and youthful. Tasty tannins and a deep dry finish that (almost) never ends. Try in 5-12 years?

I have never been selfish with you. I never invited you to my prom because i thought you were taken. I never told you to leave that life i thought you loved for my true love I never told you i loved you when i thought i loved another I never swam those seas All the while searching for approximations of each other Achieving only variants, always skirting around the possibility Shirking the responsibility of success Shedding skin after skin We are moths to flames and the ashes of wings burnt to a cinder

I love this Rioja! I last tasted the 2009 vintage two years ago... Ripe nose of dark berries, like dark cherries and blueberries; well balanced palate of fruity and spicy notes and good acidity completes a well composed palate. At this price level this is definitely one of my favourite Rioja wines!

90 Points, drink now until 2025. Medium ruby coloured with tawny rims. Sweet nose of American oak, vanilla, dill, chocolate, hazelnut, noisette, black, cherry and licorice, balsamico and honey. Great potpourri of flavors in the nose, on the tongue relatively balanced with animating acidity, full body with a slight dip in fruit, finishing medium. Good value, hard to find a better Rioja for your spend!

Dark, almost inky purple in the glass. Nose has a vibrant fruitiness with the smallest hint of balsamic, vanilla, and baking spices. Front is full of cherry and raspberry with a hint of balsamic. Texture is soft with medium acidity and medium body. Middle introduces pleasant mild that intensify to medium tannins in the mid length finish. Very drinkable, if young, and is delicious alone. Paired with pork, it’s sublime!

Promptly tasting like melons with light acidity it is the perfect wine for a long phone call on a night in. Truly truly lovely.

Deep crystal ruby with dark red rims, no legs, no tears at 15.5% ABV. Strong nose is dried red and black berries, strong eucalyptus, earthy notes of forrest after rain, interesting spices hail with the regular mix like turmeric, linden. Full body, med+ acid, large silky tannins. Dry palate is still elegant with full nose flavors turn to taste here with resins and balsamic souce. Finish is med+ strength but unending with full flavors. I smoked a Cohiba siglo VI cigar with it and fellas that's life!! 😜🎶

Excellent wine tasting at the Rubaiyat Restaurant at the Caballo Loco Event. The name is a tribute to one of the owners, Jorge Coderch whose nickname is Crazy Horse. Made with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Carmenere and 5% Malbec. Aged for 18 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate, tobacco, spices, vanilla and mineral. On the palate good body, structured, good complexity and acidity. Soft tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!!

Gorgeous nose hints of African spices and cumin. Once drank it's smooth and seductive, with mystery and sensuality. There's no single flavor that dominates but instead it slowly reveals different colors as you enjoy the glass: licorice, currant, and is that pumpkin? Would pare well with a bold spicy soup as well as the traditional red meat plate. Highly recommended.

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

A very vivid green tinge in this delightful wine. Strong aroma of citrus, Tropic and stone fruit..,. It has it all! The flavour is of minerals and sweet citrus with a lively buttery mouthfeel.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it.

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

Bright light golden colour. Pure, fresh and youthful nose, no noticeable oak, fresh fruit like crushed apple, pear and citrus. Medium bodied palate, pure and crisp fruit, well balanced in a pure unoaked style with plenty of lively acidity, juicy fruit and a long warm but fresh finish.

Nice fruity smell, with a taste of peach and a perfect amount of acid, balanced to the fruity side and a superb affordable alternative to a summer rose on a hot day. Close to 4,5 stars, but misses an edge to be differentiated enough for that.

Ripe aromas of cassis, dried cherry and sultana all strewn across an old sun hardened plank of oak. Big, bold and boozy, very ripe fruit forward palate. Gritty coffee grind tannins and one of those finishes thats all texture no flavour. All in all it exceeded my expectations. Age may benefit. 3.8

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence.

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

The color of winter sunlight, Trimbach’s 2016 Reverve Riesling is made from old vines planted on the winery’s estate parcels notably classed as Grand Cru—these vineyards lie within ancient calcareous limestone soils studded with fossilized seashells known as “Muschelkalk.” A kaleidoscope of white peach, yellow apple, lemongrass, lemon pith, wet stone and kerosene. In the mouth it’s lithe and linear. White grapefruit, apricot pit, bitter almond twine bracing, racy acidity that hits the sides of the tongue.

A no brainer for breakfast pairing in an airport lounge. Nose is a touch austere. Scents of kiwi and rubber bands.. Palate is a rush of citrus and tropics. Kiwi, pineapple, lime zest, white flower. Piercing sharpness and high acidity emphasising the concentration and energy of the wine. Mouth-drying, eye-watering long finish. Yes, Trimbach produce many better wines than this. But even their huge production entry level is bloody great.

Great white wine tasted at the Grand Cru with friends before starting the Event One Night in Italy. Broglia is one of the most traditional producers in the region of Gavi. Considered an icon of the house. Made with 100% Cortese di Gavi. Without passing through wood. Aromas of peach, apple, pear, lemon, tangerine, almonds, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, structured, good complexity and acidity. Ends with great persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!

Beautfiul pale gold in the glass, the fruit on the nose jumps out like walking through a pear orchard. Lots of green apple and a hint of over-ripe yellow apple and elderflower. Light-medium bodied, this one is nicely dry and acidic, with a soft but persistent astringency. 4.1 ⭐️ from me. Deluxxe!

Lovely crisp Gavi. Had this in Sauze d’Oulx on a mountain restaurant terrace in beautiful spring sunshine. I expect the setting had a lot to do with my enjoyment of this wine, but it really was nice. Clean, crisp and fresh, grassy aromas, flinty zesty taste and a smooth finish.

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

Viva la France Mövenpick winetasting #1. As new 2015 vintage of Bordeaux has arrived, this time we focused mostly on red. This wine shows a bit more age and develops very nice. On the nose intensive deep ripe fruits - plums and cherries, vanilla, chocolate, notes of lacorice, with developing mushrooms and tabacco. On the palate the wine is quite fruity, with considerable amount of already rounded tannins, balancing acidity, coffee, chocolate, long aftertaste. Although not the best vintage, it is great!

Ripe aromas of cassis, dried cherry and sultana all strewn across an old sun hardened plank of oak. Big, bold and boozy, very ripe fruit forward palate. Gritty coffee grind tannins and one of those finishes thats all texture no flavour. All in all it exceeded my expectations. Age may benefit. 3.8

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

This Toscana blend is quite typical, Sangiovese plus some Canaiolo, always present in Chiantis. This one, much softer than Chiantis, though. Aroma of raspberries, clove and dark chocolate. Mild tannins, medium body and acidity, easy to drink and to pair. Good wine. $ 25 in Brazil, probably half that elsewhere.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Clear light lemon-green color. Medium nose with green apples and citrus notes. Dry wine with medium acidity, citrus notes and pear. Some flowers too. A bitter aftertaste. Some herbal notes. Seems unripe. Acceptable wine at most. Cheers friends 🥂

The very first of the horizontal tasting among the different Las Moras ""clos"". Bright red rubi of moderate intensity, Flowers and fresh red fruits with a somewhat ""earthy"" character. Mid boddied, correct acidit, lack of strenght on palate, and complexity in terms of length. 83 GGP

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

This Toscana blend is quite typical, Sangiovese plus some Canaiolo, always present in Chiantis. This one, much softer than Chiantis, though. Aroma of raspberries, clove and dark chocolate. Mild tannins, medium body and acidity, easy to drink and to pair. Good wine. $ 25 in Brazil, probably half that elsewhere.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Muito bom vinho. Aromas de pêssegos, maça verde, frutas cítricas, florais e erva-doce. Na boca é frutado, leve, seco, refrescante e álcool bem equilibrado. Final agradável de boa persistência. Feliz Natal! Saúde!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

The top end of the Mazzei range this is always a 50/50 Sangiovese and Merlot blend only from the best parcels of the estate. The nose is almost pronounced with aromas of blackberry, blueberries and black cherries with a spiced plum finish. Plenty of forest floor, vanilla and toast that’s well integrated. Acidity, tannins and alcohol are high and well balanced. This wine is still young and I think we have just opened it’s drinking potential, with easily another 20 or so years to go!

Medium magenta colour. On the nose blackberries, black currants, eucalyptus, liquorice and vanilla. On the palate full bodied with chewy tannins, intense fruit on the mid palate. Acidity is high and it finishes with plums and tobacco. This is almost there and needs at least a bit over a year to be ready.

Decant this 2017. Still a bit young and developing. Aromas of black fruit and herbal. M+tannins. M+body. In the distance remembering you of a Nebbiolo. @everyone-takes-a-holidaywine-tasting with friends.

Intensive, ink-like purple, in thick consistency, this Dolcetto comes fruity and earthy in nose and palate. Aromas somewhat shy and reserved, probably owing to its only 1 year of age. Great tannins and acid, well balanced and with good body and finish. A very nice Dolcetto, that has his best times in the next 2-3 years. (Nov 2018).

Rounded up for value This Chilean SB is the house wine every time I’m in Mexico, as it’s readily available at every corner store & is cheap cheap cheap Nothing to write home about but won’t offend the palate. Green apple, citrus, topical fruit, hint of lemongrass. A drinkable cheap wine, and that’s a compliment! I find cheap whites are easier to drink than cheap reds, if my arm is being bent to drink them 😝🤘🏼

Very light yellow crystal color! Like a K-color diamond. Nose is stongly packed with all the fresh fruits of pinaples, yellow apples, passion fruit, limes, plums, bananas and mandarine. All these smells turn to tastes on the palate with this med body med+ acid wine. Finish is long and intense with nothing other then palate and nose. (I sometimes really don't like the green grass thing or garlick to me! And this one is free of them!) Ok not very complex I agree but a nice day wine without meal.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Straw in Color, asparagus , nectarine, line zest and oyster rocks. Pink peppercorn. Medium plus viscosity, high viscosity, high alcohol content. Tried this at an enoversity tasting! What a great event! It's at Eno, at the intercontinental, every 3rd Sunday of the month ! Well worth the price tag.

Vivanco Crianza is a modern tempranillo from Rioja. 16 months in American and french oak. Fruit driven , sweet berries and a little dash of spice. Rewarding and round. Great with a mallorcan barbecue! Salut from the Llevant hills.

My observation is find any pomerol wine label that have a cross on them, you won't go wrong. Then again for me I can pick up any pomerol and still like it. I think this is the 2nd wine but it is not bad. And a very good vintage.

On the day that England dismantled, belittled and quite frankly executed a young french rugby team, it seems rather fitting to enjoy a mediocre Rhône wine. Facing 2 defeats on the bounce, firstly from a nation with a smaller population than that of Paris is somewhat humiliating, but together we stand, and basque in the glory of consuming export grade french wine. Who’s the real winner?

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it.

Another Portugese gem! This delicious red is a blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional, Alicante Bouschet and Tinta Roriz ( Tempranillo) The bouquet is intense and complex revealing aromas of ripe forest fruits combined with clove , dried roses and licorice On the palate it is smooth, full bodied, medium dry and balanced with beautifully integrated tannins and persisting finish that invites you to take the next sip Paired with a juicy an tender steak grilled on open fire 🔥😋😋 Score 88!

Dark, almost inky purple in the glass. Nose has a vibrant fruitiness with the smallest hint of balsamic, vanilla, and baking spices. Front is full of cherry and raspberry with a hint of balsamic. Texture is soft with medium acidity and medium body. Middle introduces pleasant mild that intensify to medium tannins in the mid length finish. Very drinkable, if young, and is delicious alone. Paired with pork, it’s sublime!

Fresh, delicate, highly drinkable Viognier from 800 m a.s.l. vineyard of Finca El Paraiso. Light golden color, pale straw glitters. Redolent of salak, wet hay, sun-dried apricot, melon, kumquat peels, suede, limestone. Clean, easy-going palate of medium body, refreshing acidity. White currant, white grapefruit, white plum, white pepper, yellow apple flavors. Kind of disturbing bitterness at the end. Finish is medium, citrus zest and white currant scented. Gone well with gilt-head bream baked in herbs. 3.4*

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais.

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying

Dark, almost inky purple in the glass. Nose has a vibrant fruitiness with the smallest hint of balsamic, vanilla, and baking spices. Front is full of cherry and raspberry with a hint of balsamic. Texture is soft with medium acidity and medium body. Middle introduces pleasant mild that intensify to medium tannins in the mid length finish. Very drinkable, if young, and is delicious alone. Paired with pork, it’s sublime!

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Love it. Better than average. Tart berries up front with a little green pepper, medium tannins and a kick of spice and acidity. I want this wine next time I throw some ribeyes on the grill.

Quite surprised about the rating. Either people don’t know that it is a skin contact wine, or they were looking for a boring typical Chilean white. Or maybe it’s both ... either way, this is nevertheless a pretty good one

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

Dark, almost inky purple in the glass. Nose has a vibrant fruitiness with the smallest hint of balsamic, vanilla, and baking spices. Front is full of cherry and raspberry with a hint of balsamic. Texture is soft with medium acidity and medium body. Middle introduces pleasant mild that intensify to medium tannins in the mid length finish. Very drinkable, if young, and is delicious alone.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais. Na boca o pêssego é bem acentuado, com leveza e álcool super equilibrado esse vinho tem o álcool na medida (11,5%), retrogosto prolongado e ótima persistência!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Another Portugese gem! This delicious red is a blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional, Alicante Bouschet and Tinta Roriz ( Tempranillo) The bouquet is intense and complex revealing aromas of ripe forest fruits combined with clove , dried roses and licorice On the palate it is smooth, full bodied, medium dry and balanced with beautifully integrated tannins and persisting finish that invites you to take the next sip Paired with a juicy an tender steak grilled on open fire 🔥😋😋 Score 88!

Dark, almost inky purple in the glass. Nose has a vibrant fruitiness with the smallest hint of balsamic, vanilla, and baking spices. Front is full of cherry and raspberry with a hint of balsamic. Texture is soft with medium acidity and medium body. Middle introduces pleasant mild that intensify to medium tannins in the mid length finish. Very drinkable, if young, and is delicious alone.

Smells more fresh and fruity compare to Malbec we tasted last time, finish is spicy - black pepper, juicy wine, black and red fruits , slightly burn feeling from alcohol. I think Malbec was bit more elegant and balanced.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Now this is a thing of ferocious beauty. Needs a good decant with very strong gripping tannins. It’s super minerally with much iron, but some broad spreading tar. It’s softening after a bit of decanting, with some slight roses starting to poke through. There are layers of liquorice and pepper in there as well. I love Nebbiolo !

100% Torrontés. Good wine. 13,5% ABV; a bit pronounced at the end but tolerable. Dry. Acidity is a bit above average. Medium straw color. Twist off cap. Produced by Finca Eugenio Bustos. Aged in stainless steel tanks. From Valle de Famatina in the La Rioja region; 600Km north of Mendoza. Great body and medium finish. Flavors of lime, pear, minerals and pineapple. Aromas of orange peel, green apple and perfume. Bought it on sale for R$19,90 at WineBr; great CxB! Paired with salmon poke at Nemo - Fortaleza.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Tropical fruits on the nose, cashew butter with Sicilian lemons (reminds me of the limoncello aroma), long after taste with lime and green apple. Good one, crisp and fresh.

100% Torrontés. Good wine. 13,5% ABV; a bit pronounced at the end but tolerable. Dry. Acidity is a bit above average. Medium straw color. Twist off cap. Produced by Finca Eugenio Bustos. Aged in stainless steel tanks. From Valle de Famatina in the La Rioja region; 600Km north of Mendoza. Great body and medium finish. Flavors of lime, pear, minerals and pineapple. Aromas of orange peel, green apple and perfume. Bought it on sale for R$19,90 at WineBr; great CxB! Paired with salmon poke at Nemo - Fortaleza.

Fermentation in oak followed by 18 months ageing in oak. Cherry flavours, light style, very fresh. Teroldego is the local variety here. Closely related to Lagrein and also a less bit to Syrah. A wine with an Alpine character.

Now this is a thing of ferocious beauty. Needs a good decant with very strong gripping tannins. It’s super minerally with much iron, but some broad spreading tar. It’s softening after a bit of decanting, with some slight roses starting to poke through. There are layers of liquorice and pepper in there as well. I love Nebbiolo !

Well balanced red from Portugal and inexpensive! Cassis, cherry, cider spices and a bit of oak on the nose, medium minus acidity but nice fruit and secondary notes on taste, form but not overbearing tannins, cherry cassis continuing with mulling spices and a little graphite, nice length on the finish and tannins in the sweet spot, killer for $7, chin chin!

3.6@home Unmatured but deeply clear crimson ruby colour. Various blackberrys and un-riped cherrys after chocolate with dried vanilla on nose. Oak, mid to high tannins. Little bit prominent acidity.

Basic, but quality and quite complex wine. Purchased grape from selected vine growers. 9-10 months maturing. Up to 15% in oak barrels, the rest in stainless steel. Mostly sour cherry and rowan tree berry with delicate nuances of green pepper and forest floor. Almost lean, very fresh, nicely balanced and pleasantly tannic. Well done by big reliable producer.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

The very first of the horizontal tasting among the different Las Moras ""clos"". Bright red rubi of moderate intensity, Flowers and fresh red fruits with a somewhat ""earthy"" character. Mid boddied, correct acidit, lack of strenght on palate, and complexity in terms of length. 83 GGP

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Whow Chilean Malbec 😍. Medium ruby/purple rim, nose full of allspice, with sweeter bramble, black currant jam and light oak traces (cocoa). Definitely on fruity side, but does not feel jammy. Medium body, polished medium tannins and same amount of acidity, dry with some RS. Elegant, balanced, tasty good value Malbec. Medum length finish With spiced damson cheese and black pepper flavor.

A blend from Alentejo with 40% Alvarinho, 20% Arinto, 40% Fernao Pires grapes Straw yellow dress The nose spread white stone fruit peach and green apple, orange blossom, lime, honeysuckle, a whiff of clove and a fine minerality. The mouth is very fruity and feels a little greasy, at the same time a crispy acidity from lemon, fruits of abricot, peach and grapefruit medium bodied with a kicking acidity that delivers freshness in the finish. 3.7 🌟

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying

My first Brazilian wine thanks to my good friend Roberto Bassan. Owned by an Italian family who immigrated to Brazil in 1897 and named their wine after the land they moved in at the time. 2012 Lote 43 is a very well made wine, kept 12 months in French Oak, 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet, has a seductive complex nose, ruby red in color, full bodied, rich, jammy yet has a soft and velvety texture, lots of black fruits, tobacco, leather. Roberto- you have to come to Istanbul more often ! Cheers to you amigo 🍷

The estate dates back to the Crusades, and Scottish navigator, George Smith, the owner in the 18th century. He was followed by M. Duffour-Dubergier, Mayor of Bordeaux, and then Louis Eschenauer, a famous wine shipper. In 1990, Daniel and Florence Cathiard now own the estate. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, darrk berry aromas, herb and spice. On the palate complex juicy black fruit flavors, cinnamon and cacao notes. Soft tannins, rich and full, lingering, mineral, youthful ending, needs time.

A blend from Alentejo with 40% Alvarinho, 20% Arinto, 40% Fernao Pires grapes Straw yellow dress The nose spread white stone fruit peach and green apple, orange blossom, lime, honeysuckle, a whiff of clove and a fine minerality. The mouth is very fruity and feels a little greasy, at the same time a crispy acidity from lemon, fruits of abricot, peach and grapefruit medium bodied with a kicking acidity that delivers freshness in the finish. 3.7 🌟

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Simple red made of a grape variety called Nero d'Avola that appears ruby red with violet hue in color, pleasant aromas of red fruits on the nose,med bodied with smooth tannins, easy but not boring, well paired with lasagna.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

My first Brazilian wine thanks to my good friend Roberto Bassan. Owned by an Italian family who immigrated to Brazil in 1897 and named their wine after the land they moved in at the time. 2012 Lote 43 is a very well made wine, kept 12 months in French Oak, 60% Merlot, 40% Cabernet, has a seductive complex nose, ruby red in color, full bodied, rich, jammy yet has a soft and velvety texture, lots of black fruits, tobacco, leather. Roberto- you have to come to Istanbul more often ! Cheers to you amigo 🍷

The estate dates back to the Crusades, and Scottish navigator, George Smith, the owner in the 18th century. He was followed by M. Duffour-Dubergier, Mayor of Bordeaux, and then Louis Eschenauer, a famous wine shipper. In 1990, Daniel and Florence Cathiard now own the estate. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, darrk berry aromas, herb and spice. On the palate complex juicy black fruit flavors, cinnamon and cacao notes. Soft tannins, rich and full, lingering, mineral, youthful ending, needs time.

Clear light lemon-green color. Medium nose with green apples and citrus notes. Dry wine with medium acidity, citrus notes and pear. Some flowers too. A bitter aftertaste. Some herbal notes. Seems unripe. Acceptable wine at most. Cheers friends 🥂

A dark purple Argentinean Syrah from3 different valleys. The nose is is complex with red fruits, spices and tobacco leafs. The palate is formidable with elegance and a wide range of flavours with a proper structure.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it.

Earthy red fruit on the nose. Soft tannins and minerals with a smooth finish. A touch of pepper lingers. At 11 bucks this is a great value. Two thumbs up.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

The palate is a dance of powerful waves of sapidity, spiciness and slight sweetness that balance the chocolate flavour in the quite long Finish.good value per money.

Very fruity But Stein wine. I tasted the years 2013 2014 and 2015. For me 2013 was the best one (best balanced). The wine tasted dark (cherry) fruits (dark berry’s) and some black pepper!! Even you can taste some black prunes. Very good!!

Happy Nebbiolo/ Piemonte Monday. With my constant diet of fish / seafood on vacation went with a white Piemonte. Arneis “aka little rascal” as it’s tough to grow. From Roero ( best region) From the great Vietti. 50th harvest of this wine So history on this wines side 😉 Enjoyable white; floral start ; yummy green apple 🍏 / unripe pear with a citrus zing. Sweet almond finish Wine has some nice weight on the palate. Quenching acidity. 3.9 rounded up cause drinking it in the sun ☀️. Yum

90 Points - A delicious Arneis from a classic Piemonte producer. Very floral aromatics, with cheerful Lemon, green and red apple, and heaps of daisies, lilac and honeysuckle. The body is full, almost waxy, and if I tasted this blind I might have guessed Marsanne. No oak to speak of, just brilliant fruits, flowers and beeswax.

Prior to the Habs game tonight... Yay! We went for an early dinner at Tapas 24 in Montreal. They had an extensive Spanish wine list. Our waiter recommended this Toro that was quite interesting. We were a little hesitant on the year, but it was quite quaffable for a young wine. Dusty cherry, ripe cassis and smoke with lots of chalky tannins. Medium acidity. It paired well with our variety of Spanish dishes. 3.8 ✨

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

3.5 Cracked open while watching the Portugal vs Uruguay game and paired with tortilla chips and very spicy salsa. The cabernet sauvignon showed up as deep red with intense purple undertones. The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

(90/100) A super elegant & sexy Sardinian masterpiece. Although exhibiting a distinct rusticity & earthiness in the mouth, the smoothness of this velvety blend makes for an incredibly rounded & approachable wine. The bouquet is fragrant & sassy, packed full of sour cherry & herbs, subtly perfumed. Perfect. The palate is punchy & tarte, brimming with sour cherry & blackberry. Creamy vanilla laden oak & a silky, persistent finish. Medium to full bodied, a zingy acidity, moderate intensity & unctuous. Epic!

Prior to the Habs game tonight... Yay! We went for an early dinner at Tapas 24 in Montreal. They had an extensive Spanish wine list. Our waiter recommended this Toro that was quite interesting. We were a little hesitant on the year, but it was quite quaffable for a young wine. Dusty cherry, ripe cassis and smoke with lots of chalky tannins. Medium acidity. It paired well with our variety of Spanish dishes. 3.8 ✨

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais. Na boca o pêssego é bem acentuado, com leveza e álcool super equilibrado esse vinho tem o álcool na medida (11,5%), retrogosto prolongado e ótima persistência!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying

Happy Nebbiolo/ Piemonte Monday. With my constant diet of fish / seafood on vacation went with a white Piemonte. Arneis “aka little rascal” as it’s tough to grow. From Roero ( best region) From the great Vietti. 50th harvest of this wine So history on this wines side 😉 Enjoyable white; floral start ; yummy green apple 🍏 / unripe pear with a citrus zing. Sweet almond finish Wine has some nice weight on the palate. Quenching acidity. 3.9 rounded up cause drinking it in the sun ☀️. Yum

90 Points - A delicious Arneis from a classic Piemonte producer. Very floral aromatics, with cheerful Lemon, green and red apple, and heaps of daisies, lilac and honeysuckle. The body is full, almost waxy, and if I tasted this blind I might have guessed Marsanne. No oak to speak of, just brilliant fruits, flowers and beeswax.

(90/100) A super elegant & sexy Sardinian masterpiece. Although exhibiting a distinct rusticity & earthiness in the mouth, the smoothness of this velvety blend makes for an incredibly rounded & approachable wine. The bouquet is fragrant & sassy, packed full of sour cherry & herbs, subtly perfumed. Perfect. The palate is punchy & tarte, brimming with sour cherry & blackberry. Creamy vanilla laden oak & a silky, persistent finish. Medium to full bodied, a zingy acidity, moderate intensity & unctuous. Epic!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying

94pts me If you ever thought Brunello is unrefined, rough, edgy when young...this will flip your table 25-36 months in french and Slovenian big barrels Ultra refinement on the nose. Immesiately guess tuscony but the refinement threw me off to Merlot instead of brunello Soft ripe sweet cherries, coacoa beans, and mocha coffee over iron driven rusty flavor and hints of well intergraded wood Such softness and plush tannin !! Ripe and sweet with a elegant lifting finish without being heavy Great wine

Aromas of blackberry, black cherry, cassis, plum, chocolate, oak, spices, mineral and floral. On the palate good body, structured, elegant, good complexity, great acidity.

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Tasted at the Artisan Chilean Wines Masterclass with Alistair Cooper, Oxford Wine Festival. Vines grown on nutrient rich volcanic soils. Nose of petroleum, green apples and gooseberries. Second time trying this wine, not feeling quite as generous as last time. Fresh palate with notes of sherbet, lime. 3.6

3.6 A good Riesling from the south of Chile. Great acidity, clean and fresh. Lots of citrus notes, hint of petrol, and green pears. A bit short in the mouth but a good wine overall. Paired nicely with a ceviche.

Daqueles intrigantes! Vem muita especiaria, coisas que sugerem até mesmo algo salgado! Depois vem frutas negras com um fundo minera. O gosto acompanha e a única coisa que destoa é o álcool un pouco intenso no início, mas equilibrando depois. Um vinho intrigante, marcante! Vale a pena!

Quite surprised about the rating. Either people don’t know that it is a skin contact wine, or they were looking for a boring typical Chilean white. Or maybe it’s both ... either way, this is nevertheless a pretty good one

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

Superb wine by Leflaive! I love the 2015 burgs and this Macon is killing it from Leflaive! 👃 Cask, vanilla, hazelnut, butter and orange peel while showing white flowers, grape peel and an acidic presence. Rich, perfumed but elegantly so. 👅 Creamy on the entry but with an always present, acidic backbone. Citron, apples, cedar, recurring white flowers and a pinch of apricot. Very approachable, but for the patient this will reward with another 2-3 years.

Very good and interesting Tuscan wine, Sangiovese and Syrah, from famous producer, a deep ruby-garnet color, with crimson reflexes. Nose: intense, ripe red fruit, cherries, raisins, cinnamon, oak,leather. In the mouth: black fruit, cherry, black plum, blackberry, spice, paprika, dried ginger, dried tomatoes, some fresh herbs, green tea, tobacco, earthy accents. Wine with a strong structure, very fruity acidity and still young, feisty tannins. Finish long and astringent with peppery aftertaste.

Deep, complex wine. Violets, raspberries, smoke, some cigar box, earth. Full body, balanced, dry finish. Moderate tannins. Wow. Certainly the best aglianco I’ve had. Well worth the money, balanced, big, and complex is the takeaway here.

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

Good value but this vintage is not as good as previous ones. Round with a bit short finish. At first intense taste but it quickly disappears. Cassis, coffee, plum, some chocolate and vanilla. Medium tannins and acidity.

3.5 Cracked open while watching the Portugal vs Uruguay game and paired with tortilla chips and very spicy salsa. The cabernet sauvignon showed up as deep red with intense purple undertones. The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Tasted at the Artisan Chilean Wines Masterclass with Alistair Cooper, Oxford Wine Festival. Vines grown on nutrient rich volcanic soils. Nose of petroleum, green apples and gooseberries. Second time trying this wine, not feeling quite as generous as last time. Fresh palate with notes of sherbet, lime. 3.6

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

Great potpourri of flavors in the nose, on the tongue relatively balanced with animating acidity, full body with a slight dip in fruit, finishing medium.

Superb wine by Leflaive! I love the 2015 burgs and this Macon is killing it from Leflaive! 👃 Cask, vanilla, hazelnut, butter and orange peel while showing white flowers, grape peel and an acidic presence. Rich, perfumed but elegantly so. 👅 Creamy on the entry but with an always present, acidic backbone. Citron, apples, cedar, recurring white flowers and a pinch of apricot. Very approachable, but for the patient this will reward with another 2-3 years.

Happy Nebbiolo/ Piemonte Monday. With my constant diet of fish / seafood on vacation went with a white Piemonte. Arneis “aka little rascal” as it’s tough to grow. From Roero ( best region) From the great Vietti. 50th harvest of this wine So history on this wines side 😉 Enjoyable white; floral start ; yummy green apple 🍏 / unripe pear with a citrus zing. Sweet almond finish Wine has some nice weight on the palate. Quenching acidity. 3.9 rounded up cause drinking it in the sun ☀️. Yum

90 Points - A delicious Arneis from a classic Piemonte producer. Very floral aromatics, with cheerful Lemon, green and red apple, and heaps of daisies, lilac and honeysuckle. The body is full, almost waxy, and if I tasted this blind I might have guessed Marsanne. No oak to speak of, just brilliant fruits, flowers and beeswax.

What makes this an iconic wine is its deep concentration of red fruit and black fruit, enticing spicy background lifted by hints of green bell pepper and leaves. The effect of oak, initially restrained and expressive at the nose with cedar and leather, explodes at the palate with vanilla laced chocolate. Medium plus finish with waves of ripe blackberries, fig, black olives and a warm, peppery end. 8% Petit Verdot.

NO APRIL FOOL My last night in Seattle, at dinner with my good friends Jay & his wife. A stunning preamble, it's hard to believe this would be the worst wine of the evening. Paired with Ahi tuna, this Carmenere needs no introduction! Such a bottomless void filled with both power & finesse. Laid on a bare spicy note, this is built of blueberry, blackberry, licorice & fruit compote dusted by aromas of violet, leather & subtle perfume. A wine that gives you shivers. 93 pts

surprisingly better than expected. although a very simple bottle, it's better than many other more expensive bottles not too much tannins, the ripe berry nose is quite pleasant. slightly salty olive on palate 15Jan2016

100% (Vitis) Vinifera Rootstock Riesling is a variety which is highly ""terroir-expressive"", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin Trivia: (1) Roter Riesling — A rare more pinkish than red Riesling grape — Crisp acidity, slightly more powerful, rounded and full bodied wines (2) Arctic Riesling — A Konstantine Frank cold weather hybrid found in the Northeastern Region States, USA 🇺🇸 — produces much drier style wines than the traditional Riesling>>

4.15/5.00. Lemon curd and biscuit on nose, with notes of lemon, vanilla, baking spices, butter / oak and mild honey on the palate. Excellent value at this price. Reminds me of a California Chardonnay, and that’s perfectly ok with me. Pair with buttery seafood dishes.

Very good Vinho Verde, blend of Arinto,Azal, Trajadura, a pale yellow-straw color with silver reflexes. Nose: lime, lemon, orange, apples, and minerality. In the mouth: fresh acidic citrus fruits, lemon and green apples, a lot of minerality. Wine crystalline, light, a bit bubbly, with bitter aftertaste.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

(4.3*) Quinta da Romaneira wine tasting. Full details on www.vaocubo.com In my opinion was the best of the afternoon. Fantastic Petit Verdot aged for 14 months in French oak. I love this grape and it's not easy to find great wines 100% PV. Deep purple in color with forest fruits aromas and cassis notes. On palate is smooth and rich with fruity tannins and flavors of blueberries, ginger and cedar. Finished fruity and very persistent.

Excellent wine and perhaps one of the best Petit Verdot I’ve tasted. Made with 100% Petit Verdot. Aged for 14 months in French oak barrels. Aromas of cherry, cassis, blueberry, blackcurrant, tobacco, gentle oak, spices and vanilla. On the palate good body, structured, complex, good acidity and freshness. Soft tannins. Long and persistent finish. I recommend with great enthusiasm!!!

What makes this an iconic wine is its deep concentration of red fruit and black fruit, enticing spicy background lifted by hints of green bell pepper and leaves. The effect of oak, initially restrained and expressive at the nose with cedar and leather, explodes at the palate with vanilla laced chocolate. Medium plus finish with waves of ripe blackberries, fig, black olives and a warm, peppery end. 8% Petit Verdot.

NO APRIL FOOL My last night in Seattle, at dinner with my good friends Jay & his wife. A stunning preamble, it's hard to believe this would be the worst wine of the evening. Paired with Ahi tuna, this Carmenere needs no introduction! Such a bottomless void filled with both power & finesse. Laid on a bare spicy note, this is built of blueberry, blackberry, licorice & fruit compote dusted by aromas of violet, leather & subtle perfume. A wine that gives you shivers. 93 pts

I’m starting to enjoy these alvarinhos! Who wouldn’t enjoy the wooden notes, a floral whiff and a little stone fruit in the nose. On the palate you have subtle zesty citrus, mixed up with tones of wood. The pleasant “sur lie” effect is a little cherry on top! What a harmonious wine!4,1⭐️

Tasted in Cantinho from @jose_avillez. Surprising knowing that Meandro has a white version so i had to try it! Pale lemon color, nice brightness. The nose is a very nice mesh with citric aromas and ripe stone fruit, very nice. Dry attack, great acidity, light bodied but long finish with frank notes. Very well done white wine!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Just sneaking in at 3.5. Gouveio 🇵🇹 blend. For those keeping score , ✅ Gouveio much more famous in NW Spain 🇪🇸 where known as Godello. This is a peachy little number with a mineral streak. Grapefruit finish. Acidity is medium. Missing some depth to the mid palate but does the trick with a chicken taco salad. Quaff away with this Portugal 🇵🇹 white.

Prune, red fruits and a hint of bay leaf in the nose. Very smooth, almost velvety taste. When you give it some air, before drinking the high alcohol taste is smoothed out. Amazing value for this price.

And then we had this lovely Riserva CC from Poggio Bonelli. Still pairing this with a small cheese and meat platter. On the nose pretty strong fruity and stale red, with dark and some red fruity aroma's, a hint of acidity, and also a pretty alcoholic edge (14%). The taste is smooth but powerfull, with ripe blackberries, ripe warm cherries, dried figs and plum, somewhat stale, cedar wood, hints of vanilla, and a tobacco edge to it all. A soft acidity, soft+ tannins, and long powerfull finish. Lovely! A 4.0!

Lovely dry Furmint aged in Hungarian oak made by Vega Sicilia. Aromas of lemon, stone fruit, green almonds, vanilla and smokey notes from the oak, as well as some minerality. Medium to full bodied, creamy but with lovely acidity underneath. The oak is very well integrated and it ends on a long finish.

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

Quite surprised about the rating. Either people don’t know that it is a skin contact wine, or they were looking for a boring typical Chilean white. Or maybe it’s both ... either way, this is nevertheless a pretty good one

This wine is well worth trying. Bitter notes from the skin contact however still fresh delicious and drinkable. Finish it on day one as the freshness dissipates quickly after about 24 hours.

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

Barolobrunello event, riserva from great vintage, more powerful wine and a bit different flavors. Light ruby color. On the nose, strong tea leafs, vanilla, cherry, mint and coffee. On palate, acidity high, body full, tannins strong. Dark fruity flavor with some soft spicy long finish. I guess this will be great in 5-10 years.

Just sneaking in at 3.5. Gouveio 🇵🇹 blend. For those keeping score , ✅ Gouveio much more famous in NW Spain 🇪🇸 where known as Godello. This is a peachy little number with a mineral streak. Grapefruit finish. Acidity is medium. Missing some depth to the mid palate but does the trick with a chicken taco salad. Quaff away with this Portugal 🇵🇹 white.

And then we had this lovely Riserva CC from Poggio Bonelli. Still pairing this with a small cheese and meat platter. On the nose pretty strong fruity and stale red, with dark and some red fruity aroma's, a hint of acidity, and also a pretty alcoholic edge (14%). The taste is smooth but powerfull, with ripe blackberries, ripe warm cherries, dried figs and plum, somewhat stale, cedar wood, hints of vanilla, and a tobacco edge to it all. A soft acidity, soft+ tannins, and long powerfull finish. Lovely! A 4.0!

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais. Na boca o pêssego é bem acentuado, com leveza e álcool super equilibrado esse vinho tem o álcool na medida (11,5%), retrogosto prolongado e ótima persistência!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

On palate, acidity high, body full, tannins strong. Dark fruity flavor with some soft spicy long finish. I guess this will be great in 5-10 years.

Lovely dry Furmint aged in Hungarian oak made by Vega Sicilia. Aromas of lemon, stone fruit, green almonds, vanilla and smokey notes from the oak, as well as some minerality. Medium to full bodied, creamy but with lovely acidity underneath. The oak is very well integrated and it ends on a long finish.

What makes this an iconic wine is its deep concentration of red fruit and black fruit, enticing spicy background lifted by hints of green bell pepper and leaves. The effect of oak, initially restrained and expressive at the nose with cedar and leather, explodes at the palate with vanilla laced chocolate. Medium plus finish with waves of ripe blackberries, fig, black olives and a warm, peppery end. 8% Petit Verdot.

NO APRIL FOOL My last night in Seattle, at dinner with my good friends Jay & his wife. A stunning preamble, it's hard to believe this would be the worst wine of the evening. Paired with Ahi tuna, this Carmenere needs no introduction! Such a bottomless void filled with both power & finesse. Laid on a bare spicy note, this is built of blueberry, blackberry, licorice & fruit compote dusted by aromas of violet, leather & subtle perfume. A wine that gives you shivers. 93 pts

I’m starting to enjoy these alvarinhos! Who wouldn’t enjoy the wooden notes, a floral whiff and a little stone fruit in the nose. On the palate you have subtle zesty citrus, mixed up with tones of wood. The pleasant “sur lie” effect is a little cherry on top! What a harmonious wine!4,1⭐️

Just sneaking in at 3.5. Gouveio 🇵🇹 blend. For those keeping score , ✅ Gouveio much more famous in NW Spain 🇪🇸 where known as Godello. This is a peachy little number with a mineral streak. Grapefruit finish. Acidity is medium. Missing some depth to the mid palate but does the trick with a chicken taco salad. Quaff away with this Portugal 🇵🇹 white.

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

Good value but this vintage is not as good as previous ones. Round with a bit short finish. At first intense taste but it quickly disappears. Cassis, coffee, plum, some chocolate and vanilla. Medium tannins and acidity.

3.5 Cracked open while watching the Portugal vs Uruguay game and paired with tortilla chips and very spicy salsa. The cabernet sauvignon showed up as deep red with intense purple undertones. The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav. Tasted home in Santiago June 30th, 2018

Tasted at the Artisan Chilean Wines Masterclass with Alistair Cooper, Oxford Wine Festival. Vines grown on nutrient rich volcanic soils. Nose of petroleum, green apples and gooseberries.

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

What makes this an iconic wine is its deep concentration of red fruit and black fruit, enticing spicy background lifted by hints of green bell pepper and leaves. The effect of oak, initially restrained and expressive at the nose with cedar and leather, explodes at the palate with vanilla laced chocolate. Medium plus finish with waves of ripe blackberries, fig, black olives and a warm, peppery end. 8% Petit Verdot.

NO APRIL FOOL My last night in Seattle, at dinner with my good friends Jay & his wife. A stunning preamble, it's hard to believe this would be the worst wine of the evening. Paired with Ahi tuna, this Carmenere needs no introduction! Such a bottomless void filled with both power & finesse. Laid on a bare spicy note, this is built of blueberry, blackberry, licorice & fruit compote dusted by aromas of violet, leather & subtle perfume. A wine that gives you shivers. 93 pts

4.1 Tasted in the cellars of Domaine Vacheron with one of the owner Denis Vacheron following the high recommendation of Alain B, Vivinoer from France. They are a certified biodynamic producer. Very nice pinot noir of medium ruby color with aromas of cherry, cranberry and spices. The palate had softer tannins and medium acidity but of excellent persistence. The grapes are grown on 50% limestone-clay and 50% silex-clay terroirs with barrel time.

Clear, light medium bluish red ruby color feathering to a pale garnet watery rim. Wild raspberry, pine needle, violet, and loamy stone aromas. Wild cherry, dried raspberry, blue plum, and tarred plank flavors. Medium body, bright acidity, fine wispy tannins, and a exotic wild berry and tarry earth finish. Angular, evergreen, earthy.

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

3.5 Cracked open while watching the Portugal vs Uruguay game and paired with tortilla chips and very spicy salsa. The cabernet sauvignon showed up as deep red with intense purple undertones. The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

Lovely dry Furmint aged in Hungarian oak made by Vega Sicilia. Aromas of lemon, stone fruit, green almonds, vanilla and smokey notes from the oak, as well as some minerality. Medium to full bodied, creamy but with lovely acidity underneath. The oak is very well integrated and it ends on a long finish.

Very Pirenee like: apples with good pinch of oak vanilla and spices. Moderately fresh with very intense, wide, flavorful midpalate. Good representative of Douro Branco.

Clean, light to medium bodied. Crisp apple. Pale green color. Wonderful San Gemignano. It is made with the Vernaccia grape rather than the more prolific and bland Trebbiano.

Dark ruby red & clear, almost black. The rich aromas are of dark plum, cedar, ripe black mulberries, some pepper & turps. The palate shows some plum, blackberry, pepper, & tarry notes with good length.

Get a bottle or three NOW. This is deep and rich in color, nose and palate. Blackberries, black cherries, saddle leather, and tobacco backed by chewy but nicely integrated tannins. Needs time in cellar or a 3-hour decant. Calls for beef or a nice cigar. Cheers.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Barolobrunello event, riserva from great vintage, more powerful wine and a bit different flavors. Light ruby color. On the nose, strong tea leafs, vanilla, cherry, mint and coffee. On palate, acidity high, body full, tannins strong. Dark fruity flavor with some soft spicy long finish. I guess this will be great in 5-10 years.

Get a bottle or three NOW. This is deep and rich in color, nose and palate. Blackberries, black cherries, saddle leather, and tobacco backed by chewy but nicely integrated tannins. Needs time in cellar or a 3-hour decant. Calls for beef or a nice cigar. Cheers.

Clean, light to medium bodied. Crisp apple. Pale green color. Wonderful San Gemignano. It is made with the Vernaccia grape rather than the more prolific and bland Trebbiano.

I’d say 3.8⭐️S is bang on for this, and bumped up to 4⭐️s for value. At $16 there’s real PQR here, and the floral, honey and fruit is complimented by a light use of oak. Refreshing and that touch of oak adds a level of complexity that makes this wine a little more interesting, while still being quite refreshing

4.1 Tasted in the cellars of Domaine Vacheron with one of the owner Denis Vacheron following the high recommendation of Alain B, Vivinoer from France. They are a certified biodynamic producer. Very nice pinot noir of medium ruby color with aromas of cherry, cranberry and spices. The palate had softer tannins and medium acidity but of excellent persistence. The grapes are grown on 50% limestone-clay and 50% silex-clay terroirs with barrel time.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence.

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais. Na boca o pêssego é bem acentuado, com leveza e álcool super equilibrado esse vinho tem o álcool na medida (11,5%), retrogosto prolongado e ótima persistência!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying

I’d say 3.8⭐️S is bang on for this, and bumped up to 4⭐️s for value. At $16 there’s real PQR here, and the floral, honey and fruit is complimented by a light use of oak. Refreshing and that touch of oak adds a level of complexity that makes this wine a little more interesting, while still being quite refreshing

4.1 Tasted in the cellars of Domaine Vacheron with one of the owner Denis Vacheron following the high recommendation of Alain B, Vivinoer from France. They are a certified biodynamic producer. Very nice pinot noir of medium ruby color with aromas of cherry, cranberry and spices. The palate had softer tannins and medium acidity but of excellent persistence. The grapes are grown on 50% limestone-clay and 50% silex-clay terroirs with barrel time.

Get a bottle or three NOW. This is deep and rich in color, nose and palate. Blackberries, black cherries, saddle leather, and tobacco backed by chewy but nicely integrated tannins. Needs time in cellar or a 3-hour decant. Calls for beef or a nice cigar. Cheers.

Already drinkable but I would like another glass in 5 years. 👁 Intense ruby color. 👃 A bit closed, med nose of very ripe black and red fruits like blue-, elder-, blackberries, cherries, prunes, added by vanilla, toast, a bit smoke, cloves and licorice. 👅 Dry with a round mouthfeel (med acidity). High alcohol, which supports the med (+) body. Med (+) high, fine tannins with a touch grain. The finish is med (+) long.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Clear light lemon-green color. Medium nose with green apples and citrus notes. Dry wine with medium acidity, citrus notes and pear. Some flowers too. A bitter aftertaste. Some herbal notes. Seems unripe. Acceptable wine at most. Cheers friends 🥂

The very first of the horizontal tasting among the different Las Moras ""clos"". Bright red rubi of moderate intensity, Flowers and fresh red fruits with a somewhat ""earthy"" character. Mid boddied, correct acidit, lack of strenght on palate, and complexity in terms of length. 83 GGP

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

This one deserves a nice review. Very well balanced wine. Aromas of strawberries and blackberries and a bit of vanilla. On the palate, strong presence of tannins, but not overwhelmingly. Acidity just in the right point to balance it and make it very smooth to drink. One of the best (if not the best so far) wines from Argentina I have ever tasted. Would rate it a 4.3 or 4.4.

A top wine in Rioja by a top winemaker. And although it is at the €55 range, it is certainly a good value for money wine. Elegancy with flavour. Pure equilibrium. Balance. Harmony. Wood is there but extremely polished. 'Black attitude' but with extreme agility. Opening with ripe black and red forest fruits. Plums. Touch of vanilla without getting to lactic. Refinement. Frank.

Yes there is fruit and clearly this is a really complex wine. At $20 retail with 2 pounds of brisket or pot roast and you will be in heaven. At an industry tasting of less expensive wines -- everyday drinkers you can find your local grocery store. As well as some hidden gems.

Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav.

Daqueles intrigantes! Vem muita especiaria, coisas que sugerem até mesmo algo salgado! Depois vem frutas negras com um fundo minera. O gosto acompanha e a única coisa que destoa é o álcool un pouco intenso no início, mas equilibrando depois. Um vinho intrigante, marcante! Vale a pena!

Quite surprised about the rating. Either people don’t know that it is a skin contact wine, or they were looking for a boring typical Chilean white. Or maybe it’s both ... either way, this is nevertheless a pretty good one

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

On the palate elegant, black berries, red pebber and young spicy chili pebbers. Cedar tree and discrete vanilla oak. Perfectly balanced wine with medium body, medium acidity and medium plus alcohol with spicy and burning and long pleasant aftertaste. Rioja at its best!

A top wine in Rioja by a top winemaker. And although it is at the €55 range, it is certainly a good value for money wine. Elegancy with flavour. Pure equilibrium. Balance. Harmony. Wood is there but extremely polished. 'Black attitude' but with extreme agility. Opening with ripe black and red forest fruits. Plums. Touch of vanilla without getting to lactic. Refinement. Frank.

November, '17. Dark and Dusty on the palate full concentration, stains the glass. dark dark Ruby, almost purple. Gorgeous. Dark tilled soil, tar, graphite, Cassis, licorice. Yes there is fruit and clearly this is a really complex wine. At $20 retail with 2 pounds of brisket or pot roast and you will be in heaven. At an industry tasting of less expensive wines -- everyday drinkers you can find your local grocery store. As well as some hidden gems.

Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)

This is much better than the average rating indicates, and that’s without factoring in the serious value that is the price. My first Chilean Merlot (and regional varietal #153 of 292) is a very South American version of Merlot. Strong flavors - cassis and blackberry - with rich layers of fruit, tannins, acidity and alcohol. Deep clear blood red in color, the alcohol warms your belly. It starts with the warmth of black pepper aroma. This is WAY too drinkable!!

Good value but this vintage is not as good as previous ones. Round with a bit short finish. At first intense taste but it quickly disappears. Cassis, coffee, plum, some chocolate and vanilla. Medium tannins and acidity.

3.5 Cracked open while watching the Portugal vs Uruguay game and paired with tortilla chips and very spicy salsa. The cabernet sauvignon showed up as deep red with intense purple undertones. The aromas are dominated by black berries with some chocolate and smoke. Smoky flavors in the mouth with a medium high tannins with medium acidity of lasting proportion. Overall, it is an Ok cab sav. Tasted home in Santiago June 30th, 2018

Tasted at the Artisan Chilean Wines Masterclass with Alistair Cooper, Oxford Wine Festival. Vines grown on nutrient rich volcanic soils. Nose of petroleum, green apples and gooseberries. Second time trying this wine, not feeling quite as generous as last time. Fresh palate with notes of sherbet, lime. 3.6

3.6 A good Riesling from the south of Chile. Great acidity, clean and fresh. Lots of citrus notes, hint of petrol, and green pears. A bit short in the mouth but a good wine overall. Paired nicely with a ceviche.

Quite surprised about the rating. Either people don’t know that it is a skin contact wine, or they were looking for a boring typical Chilean white. Or maybe it’s both ... either way, this is nevertheless a pretty good one

Medium straw colour with a faint yellow tint. Interesting floral and fresh nose with hints of cantaloupe, red and yellow pears, only slight notes of mineral and petrol - in this sense not quite typical. Filling and lasting aftertaste with prevalent floral and fruit bowl notes. Hints of yellow gooseberries, stored and soft apples, and a very mild and dwindling acidity. Interesting and becoming wine, albeit not typically Riesling in MHO. Serve chilled, but not necessarily on ice.

A top wine in Rioja by a top winemaker. And although it is at the €55 range, it is certainly a good value for money wine. Elegancy with flavour. Pure equilibrium. Balance. Harmony. Wood is there but extremely polished. 'Black attitude' but with extreme agility. Opening with ripe black and red forest fruits. Plums. Touch of vanilla without getting to lactic. Refinement. Frank.

November, '17. Dark and Dusty on the palate full concentration, stains the glass. dark dark Ruby, almost purple. Gorgeous. Dark tilled soil, tar, graphite, Cassis, licorice. Yes there is fruit and clearly this is a really complex wine. At $20 retail with 2 pounds of brisket or pot roast and you will be in heaven. At an industry tasting of less expensive wines -- everyday drinkers you can find your local grocery store. As well as some hidden gems.

Wine tasting at Quinta Nova winery: This blend of old vines (75%) and Tinta Roriz (25%) was our favorite. Deep dark red in the glass, it is a powerful, ripe and fruity wine which is both concentrated and superbly generous. It has swathes of black fruits, dark tannins and minerality, all striated with acidity and a firm black plum skin texture. It‘s really good now, but it has more ageing potential. (4.3 points)

Great potpourri of flavors in the nose, on the tongue relatively balanced with animating acidity, full body with a slight dip in fruit, finishing medium.

Mostly good but not a taste for everyone. Can have a slightly cough medicine taste. However great to see the cinsault from itata begin to evolve in Chile. It’s light and refreshing. Strawberry jam on the nose with some earthy tones as well. In mouth light and fresh.

Excellent with steak! Laden with minerals, tannins, tobacco, green pepper and cherry (even strawberry). Rewards a substantial decant.

Now this is a thing of ferocious beauty. Needs a good decant with very strong gripping tannins. It’s super minerally with much iron, but some broad spreading tar. It’s softening after a bit of decanting, with some slight roses starting to poke through. There are layers of liquorice and pepper in there as well. I love Nebbiolo !

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Ruby-red colour, aromas of red fruits, leather and chocolate. On palate is full bodied and very firm with fine tannins and flavours of vanilla and cedar. Finished strong and ripe.

A pleasant, very fresh nose of limes, green apple and lemon juice. Then grass, green unripe pineapple, green chilli pepper and a whiff of coconut cream and a hint of gasoline. On the palate, medium + acidity and a long tart lemony finish. Easy to drink.

One of the least eventful noses I have encountered in a while. There is almost nothing here to smell save for a single warm alcohol note that is not entirely unpleasant but doesn't get you excited. The palate is where it shines. Fruit forward and immediately bracing. Lots of lush fruit. Tapers to a warming spicy centre and then finished tight and clean with a nice palate cleaning astringency and some very fine tannins. Worth a try. Easy to enjoy.

A dense, polished red, with mouthcoating layers of grilled plum, dried blackberry and currant fruit, underscored by savory spice and herb elements. Charcoal, licorice and dried floral aromas fill the firm finish.

Citrus peel and oak on the nose. High grippy tannis, high acidity, dry, medium bodied. Complex dark fruit notes woth a great finish. Acidity is high without being harsh and makes a great simple dinner wine. Highly recommended for its price range.

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence. I recommend with enthusiasm!!!

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Citrus peel and oak on the nose. High grippy tannis, high acidity, dry, medium bodied. Complex dark fruit notes woth a great finish. Acidity is high without being harsh and makes a great simple dinner wine. Highly recommended for its price range.

Dark garnet color; red and black berry nose; 13% ABV. Medium to full bodied 100% montepulciano d'abruzzo from 10-20 year old vines. Ripe cherries, plum, boysenberry, and vanilla. Paired beautifully with beef and sausage lasagna. Great QPR.

Para quem não tem um Brunello, vai deste Montepulciano D’abruzzo, vinho macio e taninos equilibrados, frutas negras, cor rubi claro, ótima persistência. Redondo. Curiosidade: este vinho é servido no Due Cuochi e Braz Trattoria in SP. For those who do not have a Brunello, I recomend this Montepulciano D'abruzzo, soft wine and balanced tannins, black fruits, light ruby color, great persistence. Round.

(4.1*) Port and Douro Wine Tasting Sao Paulo 2018. My forth vintage of this tradition wine from Douro, every vintage is a different blend and in this year is composed by 75% Touriga Nacional, 15% Touriga Franca and 10% Tinto Cão aged for 14 months in French oak with 13,5% abv. Ruby-red colour, aromas of red fruits, leather and chocolate. On palate is full bodied and very firm with fine tannins and flavours of vanilla and cedar. Finished strong and ripe.

Blind tasting at Romans part 2... Wow, tonights my lucky night! Again I guesed grape, country and vintage correct ☺. This Douro has nice black cherry and current impressions. Lots of herbs and spices, black chocolate and rubber make it interesting. On palate dense, round, balanced with beautifully integrated oak, chocolate and herbs again. Nice 18/20.

3.5. Tasting at Poggio San Polo (Poggio means hill, there's a lot of hills in Montalcino so a lot of wineries with Poggio in the name 😎). This winery is owned by Allegrini, much more famous for their wines in the Valpolicella region (Amarone etc). The Rubio is a blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot, and 5% Cab Franc. No detailed notes.

A dense, polished red, with mouthcoating layers of grilled plum, dried blackberry and currant fruit, underscored by savory spice and herb elements. Charcoal, licorice and dried floral aromas fill the firm finish.

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Very good wine tasted as preparation for the Decanter Wine Day in Rio de Janeiro. Made with 100% Gewürztraminer. Aged for 3 months in stainless steel tanks on the lees. Without passing through wood. Aromas of orange zest, peach, apricot, pear, mineral and floral. On the palate medium body, good structure and complexity. Great acidity and freshness. Ends with good persistence.

The very first of the horizontal tasting among the different Las Moras ""clos"". Bright red rubi of moderate intensity, Flowers and fresh red fruits with a somewhat ""earthy"" character. Mid boddied, correct acidit, lack of strenght on palate, and complexity in terms of length. 83 GGP

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

One of the least eventful noses I have encountered in a while. There is almost nothing here to smell save for a single warm alcohol note that is not entirely unpleasant but doesn't get you excited. The palate is where it shines. Fruit forward and immediately bracing. Lots of lush fruit. Tapers to a warming spicy centre and then finished tight and clean with a nice palate cleaning astringency and some very fine tannins. Worth a try. Easy to enjoy.

Ruby-red colour, aromas of red fruits, leather and chocolate. On palate is full bodied and very firm with fine tannins and flavours of vanilla and cedar. Finished strong and ripe.

Lots of herbs and spices, black chocolate and rubber make it interesting. On palate dense, round, balanced with beautifully integrated oak, chocolate and herbs again. Nice 18/20.

Simple red made of a grape variety called Nero d'Avola that appears ruby red with violet hue in color, pleasant aromas of red fruits on the nose,med bodied with smooth tannins, easy but not boring, well paired with lasagna.

The very first of the horizontal tasting among the different Las Moras ""clos"". Bright red rubi of moderate intensity, Flowers and fresh red fruits with a somewhat ""earthy"" character. Mid boddied, correct acidit, lack of strenght on palate, and complexity in terms of length. 83 GGP

Um dos topos de linha da Las Moras, somente importante ressaltar que a variação de preço dele é gritante de um lugar pra outro. Vale pesquisar. Bom, mas falando de vinho... Coloração rubi médio com translucidez visível. Tem uma cor similar a sucos de uva integral. Lágrimas finas mas bem longas. No aroma é muito bom. Frutas vermelhas e negras maduras, muitas especiarias, tabaco e madeira evidentes, fechando com bom floral. Paladar seco e com boa acidez. Álcool quase perfeito e final longo. 👌

Nose is crisp with flashes of cassis. The flavor profile follows in suit with notes of cassis, prune, black cherry and a robust burst of smoke on the tail end. The tannins are present, but more mild compared to most French wines I’ve tried. She’s strikingly light and smooth with mild acidity as well. The tannins are more present than the acid structure suggests. They have a “zing” on the finish that is delightful. A very solid bottle!

Ok, we've opened up this SB from Argentina as well, just to compare it with SB's from Chile. Different definetly. It is somehow more outspoken fruity then SB's from Chile, which is most of the time the case with SB's from Argentina. But this one is a bit more crisp and higher in the acid's. Still very nice though! Easy going white for a wide audience again. A well deserved 3.0 star + an extra 0.5 for it's price! 3.5 in total! Enjoy Easter everybody!

Coloração amarelo ouro nos leva a crer que vem pela frente um exemplar adocicado e maduro! Ledo engano, no olfato herbáceo, com nuances de pêssego e florais. Na boca o pêssego é bem acentuado, com leveza e álcool super equilibrado esse vinho tem o álcool na medida (11,5%), retrogosto prolongado e ótima persistência!

Cor amarelo dourado intenso, com leves tons esverdeados. No nariz, perfume levemente adocicado, lembrando mel e flores do campo. Na boca, leve, seco, com extrema mineralidade, longa permanência de sabores frutados. Um vinho excelente para um dia quente, acompanhando ostras frescas e ostras gratinadas com roquefort e pera, à beira da baía sul de Floripa!

This wine was chosen to best sweet wine in italy for the 2005 vintage, the 2006 is just as good. The grapes are dried +6 months and the effect is a full bodied sweet wine that cries out for large glasses and more bottles. The price is around 50€ 1/2 bottle but it is worth it. Best recioto i have had the pleasure of trying
